modern slavery statement 2023 introduction this statement is made pursuant to section 54 of the uk modern slavery act 2015 (the âactâ). it sets out the steps taken by renewi plc (the âcompanyâ) and our other group companies (the âgroupâ) during the financial year ending 31 march 2023 to prevent modern slavery or human trafficking in our own operations and supply chains. modern slavery is a term used to encapsulate offences in the act and takes various forms such as slavery, servitude, forced labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a personâs liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. businesses must be aware of the risks of modern slavery, not only ensuring there are appropriate working conditions within their own business, but also satisfying themselves that there is no modern slavery within its supply chain, plus taking appropriate action where necessary. renewi takes a zero tolerance stance on modern slavery. ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of our colleagues is a top priority and is at the core of our approach. the board seeks to continue to re\u0002enforce this throughout renewiâs operations and supply chains. should any member of staff, supplier or service provider act to the contrary, the board of renewi plc (the âboardâ) will not hesitate to take appropriate measures. through identifying potential and actual risks, then adopting measures to combat such, the board is confident, as far as possible, that there are and will continue to be sufficient measures and controls in place to discourage and deter modern slavery within our own business and those of our suppliers. renewiâs policies reflect our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all of our business relationships. however, we acknowledge that we must remain vigilant to the risks and ensure that our suppliers and service providers understand and play their part in ensuring that modern slavery and human trafficking does not occur in our own operations or supply chains. where necessary, we look to further strengthen controls throughout our business and our wider supply chain and seek to develop renewiâs policies in line with best practice and continuous improvement principles. for the purposes of this statement ârenewiâ refers to all group companies of renewi plc. appendix 1 lists the companies within the group. 1. our organisation renewi is a leading waste-to-product company, with deep expertise and an extensive breadth of waste management products and services. we focus on extracting value from waste and turning it into new materials rather than on its disposal through mass burn incineration or landfill. operating across three business divisions (commercial waste, mineralz & water and specialities), renewi handles almost 11 million tonnes of waste a year, of which 90% is either recycled or used for energy recovery and employs over 6,500 individuals in the uk and europe. (newline)  (newline) our six core values provide the foundations for everything we do at renewi and differentiates us from our competitors. we believe that how we act is just as important as what we do. our values underpin renewiâs commitment to run our business in a way that makes a positive contribution to our colleagues, customers and communities; including playing our part in eradicating modern slavery. furthermore, renewi subscribes to the 10 principles of the un global compact, an international initiative by the united nations to promote improved human rights, working conditions, environmental protection and anti-corruption. businesses, including renewi, that subscribe to these 10 principles commit to the following: human rights principle 1: support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. labour principle 3: uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; principle 4: promote the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; principle 5: promote the effective abolition of child labour; and principle 6: promote the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. environment principle 7: support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. anti-corruption principle 10: work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. as a part of global community, renewi recognizes its obligation to contribute to the un sustainable development goals. among them, goal 8, to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. goal 8 determines the actions to be taken including immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms. these core values and principles form the basis of renewiâs code of conduct, which applies to all employees, agency workers, interns and individuals working for the company on a contractual basis. the code of conduct outlines the conduct expected of individuals working for renewi but also what these individuals can expect from renewi. (newline)  (newline) 2. annual review and steps taken this statement is reviewed annually by the board of renewi plc and was approved for publication on our website and for submission to the modern slavery statement registry in september 2023. we published our first modern slavery statement in may 2017. since then, renewi has focused on strengthening the approach to the prevention of modern slavery within the renewi business and supply chains, particularly in the areas of greatest risk. summary of steps taken by renewi in 2022/23 â¢ in 2022/23 there was continuation of our approach to anti-slavery, paying particular attention to roll\u0002out into the benelux. the main area of focus remained that of the use of short-term temporary labour, a known area of higher risk for the waste sector. â¢ the actions to further mitigate the risks of modern slavery have included: o creating awareness among our benelux suppliers on our modern slavery statement and expectations in this area; o obtaining information from suppliers of temporary labour in order to assess the options to reducing suppliers of temporary labour to a shorter list of trusted suppliers; o implementing a project to reduce the number suppliers of temporary labour in benelux from over 100 to 11 key suppliers in the netherlands and 3 key suppliers in belgium; o continued use of standard contracts and terms and conditions (which have been updated in the previous years) promoting modern slavery compliance in our supply chain and enabling carrying out supplier audits. â¢ following on from the campaign held in 2021, renewi again supported anti-slavery day in the uk on october 18, to raise awareness among staff and the public. internal messages were circulated, and posters displayed. messages were also posted on our social media platforms, intended to both educate and signpost to help and support, while underlining renewiâs commitment to a modern slavery free environment. â¢ renewi plc submitted its 2022 modern slavery statement to the uk government modern slavery statement registry. planned steps to be taken by renewi in 2023/24 â¢ efforts will continue to further unify practices in the uk and benelux, with the ambition of eventually having one group-wide approach to modern slavery. â¢ the execution of the plan of actions regarding the risk related to the supply of short-term temporary labour (as set out above) will be continued, focussing on: o designing awareness campaigns tailored for benelux; o facilitating closer relationships between our key suppliers of temporary labour in benelux with dedicated renewi account managers, o investigation of the deployment on online tools and services to further develop transparency in our supply chains; o identification and review of any requirements emanating from the corporate sustainability reporting directive (csrd), developing any implementation plans as may be required â¢ there will be another anti-slavery awareness campaign held during anti-slavery week (16 â 22 october) and on anti-slavery day itself (18 october 2023). â¢ in 2023/24 the group intends to review its approach to modern slavery to ensure that our initiatives in this area remain robust and appropriate for the business. 3. our business and supply chains renewi regularly uses agency labour procured through third party providers and sources materials and waste for our business through external businesses. the majority of our suppliers are uk or eu companies based in western europe. (newline)  (newline) having undertaken a risk assessment, we have concluded that the greatest modern slavery risks lie within our supply chains and that we would benefit from a higher degree of oversight in relation to our indirect suppliers and contractors, where the modern slavery risk is deemed higher. renewi remains committed to identifying such potential risks and responds appropriately. our group procurement team works closely with our suppliers and service providers. where possible, we build long-standing relationships with these parties, making clear our expectation that suppliers and service providers take the same anti-slavery and human trafficking stance as renewi and take reasonable steps to ensure the same is adhered to within their own supply chains. all suppliers of labour, goods and services to renewi must comply with relevant legislation and international standards as relevant to their industry, including child and forced labour, health and safety of workers, non-discrimination, employment law, human rights, fraud, bribery and corruption. where required by law, suppliers and service providers must produce an annual modern slavery statement pursuant to section 54(1) of the modern slavery act 2015. renewi takes action to ensure that suppliers comply with renewiâs policies by screening significant suppliers on sustainability issues, including human rights and labour standards. we intend to explore online tools to improve our control and monitoring of our supply chain as renewi grows and evolves. further control mechanisms in the yearly supplier audits are in place, carried out by external auditor(s), as part of our iso certification. it has been contractually agreed with the key suppliers of temporary labour that they organize self-assessments to investigate potential issues, including risk of modern slavery, and to discuss the outcomes with renewi in management review meetings. during the year, we implemented a comprehensive hr system that will enable the integration of legacy personnel administration systems from across the group. external workforce management was key requirement in the tender process for the system. the system selected has the capability to facilitate improved management of data on our temporary/ flexible workforce. in 2018/19 group payment and employment practices for our permanent employees were harmonised as part of the post-merger rationalisation. however, we recognise the risks highlighted in light of operation fort, the largest modern slavery and human trafficking case to go through the british courts, where victims were found working as short-term temporary staff for some of the ukâs most well\u0002known waste companies. renewi operates a preferred supplier list for the provision of direct temporary labour, contract workers and the recruitment of new employees. we only work with recruitment agencies that share our stance against all forms of modern slavery. any health, safety and environmental breaches or incidents by or involving service providers or temporary staff is reported to the board and appropriate action taken. should any indicators of modern slavery be identified, we would work with our suppliers to investigate and where appropriate, report to the necessary authorities. should renewi consider a supplier or service provider has failed to comply with any of the above, we will undertake review of the supplier or service providers contract, resulting in appropriate action being taken for any breach, up to immediate termination of the contract. 4. our staff ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of our colleagues is crucial to renewiâs success and this responsibility is taken very seriously. our people are crucial to our continued success. their dedication and commitment to our âwaste no moreâ goal is one of the key reasons our customers choose to work with us. this is why the health, safety, wellbeing and engagement of our people is a top priority for renewi. this starts with making sure our colleagues go home safely every day. all colleagues must adhere to renewiâs code of conduct, and our company policies including bullying and harassment, disciplinary, equal opportunities and grievance. our code of conduct includes reference to laws such as the modern slavery act 2015, setting out our expectations, and detailing how (newline)  (newline) suspected instances of modern slavery should be reported to our integrity team through the 24/7 confidential whistle-blowing hotline. our policies are clearly defined and communicated. our colleagues are treated fairly and equally and are paid at least the national minimum wage and renewi complies with our obligations under the working time regulations. to raise awareness of modern slavery and trafficking and of our policies and procedures, an e-learning training model has been developed to train colleagues in the uk with responsibilities for people management and recruitment. in the future this will also include e-learning in the benelux, as our approach towards modern slavery is further rolled-out into the rest of the group. further to this, every october, as part of anti-slavery day, we hold an annual group-wide awareness campaign to help our staff understand how to recognise and report instances of modern slavery. we also raise awareness of renewiâs zero tolerance approach to modern slavery through our group magazine and other communication platforms. in 2019 renewi established a modern slavery working group to help drive a more unified approach to modern slavery. the working group comprises representatives from hr, legal and procurement departments from across the group and helps drive renewiâs approach to modern slavery, and where required, makes recommendations to the board over its modern slavery obligations. a primary focus for this group has been to promote awareness in the various countries in which we operate, recognising the varying levels of awareness around the risk of modern slavery within those countries. this will include training for our managers and communication campaigns to create awareness amongst employees. all sites are overseen by competent management teams to ensure optimum control of the work environment. 5. other the following companies

the code is not meant to replace detailed policies, but is a statement of our principles in a number of important areas and sets the framework within which all other policies should be interpreted. group-wide policies can be found in the core group policies library on the ri intranet; from the home page, click the âcore group policiesâ tile to navigate to this library. some group policies lay down absolute standards. others give guidance indicating a framework within which businesses must set their own individual operating procedures, which will be communicated directly to you as they affect the performance of your job. our mission, vision and values violations of the code of conduct violations of the code or laws and regulations may subject employees to disciplinary action including termination of employment. as a rentokil initial colleague, you are expected to act in accordance with company values and business principles and comply with company policies, as well as national laws and applicable regulations and to respect the human rights of others. the company values and business principles are an expression of who we are and how we want to be perceived by others.

(newline)  (newline) 8 code of conduct equality and fairness we value diversity and inclusion and insist on fair treatment for all in a work environment free of discrimination and harassment. rentokil initial is committed to treating all colleagues, customers, suppliers, and any other individuals with dignity and respect and to complying with all relevant employment laws and regulations to ensure a discrimination-free environment for all. the companyâs values promote a culture where mutual respect and individual growth are key ingredients in our success. it is usually unlawful and always contrary to this code to give less favourable treatment or engage in any conduct that negatively affects another colleague (such as imposing discipline, rejecting someone for promotion, affecting someoneâs pay or benefits) or to harass another person on the basis of gender (including gender identity), age, race, skin colour, ethnic or national origin, trade union membership, marital status, pregnancy, disability, religion, sexual orientation, or other discrimination forbidden by local law. rentokil initial will not tolerate any verbal or physical conduct that could be considered intimidating, hostile, or offensive and will take appropriate disciplinary action in cases of unacceptable conduct. examples of harassment could include: n using offensive nicknames, language, or gestures. n unwelcome and inappropriate jokes, teasing, or banter. n displaying offensive emails, pictures, or clothing. n physically threatening or intimidating someone. n excluding others from conversations or social events. examples of sexual harassment could include: n unwelcome advances, propositions, or flirting. n unwanted physical contact or staring. n inappropriate comments about a personâs appearance including their clothing or body. n lewd or suggestive remarks, questions, gestures, language, stories, or jokes. n sharing inappropriate images or videos. n never unlawfully or unfairly discriminate against individuals or groups based on factors not relevant to their ability to perform their job. n behave in a professional and courteous manner and not to engage in harassment, bullying or offensive behaviour in the workplace. n take personal responsibility for upholding company standards by treating with dignity and respect all job applicants, other colleagues, contractors, customers, and all parties with whom they come into contact in the course of our business. n conduct recruitment processes and management of colleagues based on merit and in a way that values, rather than simply tolerates, differences and allows a flexible and inclusive work environment that supports all of our people in achieving their potential. n report any concerns of discrimination and harassment and cooperate in any investigation that is conducted. managers should properly investigate any concerns that are reported to them. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the dignity at work & human rights and the diversity, equality & inclusion policies under core group policies on the ri intranet, as well as local hr resources applicable to your business. speak you can speak to your manager, hr team, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: i have worked in a mainly male team for several years until recently when a few more women have joined. we enjoy quite a lot of male banter, but recently one of the new joiners became offended by some of our language. it felt like an over-reaction, but do we need to moderate our behaviour to avoid offending them even if this is what we have always done and donât mean any harm by it? a: we should be polite, professional, and respectful in the workplace. we should be conscious of our behaviour and need to ensure we avoid causing offence in the first place. if someone has indicated they are offended then yes you definitely should change your behaviour and language to ensure we maintain a great working environment for everyone. (newline)  (newline) 9 code of conduct n respect the rights of all colleagues and other individuals with whom they come into contact. n require suppliers and other business partners to adopt similar standards regarding human rights. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the dignity at work & human rights policy and the supplier code under core group policies on the ri intranet. speak you can speak to your manager, hr team, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: i recently visited a supplier and saw people working in the packing room who appeared to be under 16. what should i do? a: remind the supplier of our policy and our requirement that our suppliers do not employ children. ask them for evidence (if safe to do so) that the people you saw are of working age. if this is not possible, discuss the matter with your line manager or raise it with your companyâs procurement manager. we must not work with suppliers who use child labour so seek advice to ensure this is managed appropriately. human rights colleagues must respect the human rights of their colleagues and all parties with whom they deal. rentokil initial is supportive of the fundamental human rights of colleagues and other individuals and is particularly vigilant to ensure these principles are upheld when operating in territories where human rights standards are of concern. the company operates strict rules over the establishment of business operations in new territories to ensure appropriate safeguards are put in place so no individualâs fundamental human rights are compromised. rentokil initial adheres to the legal minimum age requirements in all the countries in which it operates. in the unlikely event that children between the age of 16 and 18 are employed, the company ensures this work does not affect or preclude schooling. rentokil initial will under no circumstances make use of forced or coerced labour, servitude, or slavery and will only employ individuals who are working of their own free will. no colleague will be deprived of identity papers, or be required to provide financial inducements to the company, to facilitate their employment. the company has also put in place procedures with a zero-tolerance approach to its suppliers relying upon the use of forced or child labour in connection with the provision of services or products to the company, as mandated in the supplier code. (newline)  (newline) 10 code of conduct protecting personal information we must all take care of the personal information we handle. we routinely hold and deal with information relating to individuals, such as employees (past and present), job applicants, customers, suppliers and other business partners (and their staff). personal data relating to individuals from which they may be identified must be handled responsibly and securely: this includes names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, employment contracts, disciplinary records and even opinions. most countries where we operate have laws relating to the collection, use, retention, and transfer of personal data. although such laws vary around the world and often change, it is our policy to ensure that any personal data must: n be fairly and lawfully processed. n be processed for limited purposes. n be accurate, adequate, relevant, and not excessive. n not be kept for longer than is necessary. n be used only for valid business purposes. n be processed in accordance with individualsâ rights. n be held securely at all times. n not be transferred without adequate protection. n stored and used in-line with any local legislation. where we hold personal financial information of employees or customers, such as credit card details, these must be handled securely in line with local legislation and where possible using a third party that is an expert in managing such information. additional care needs to be taken where personal data is classified as sensitive. sensitive data includes information about an individualâs health, race, religion, political views, criminal convictions, or sexual practices. we can only disclose such information where the individual has given his or her valid consent, or where there is a legal obligation that we do so â e.g., an accident report. we owe it to the people with whom we work and deal to keep their personal information secure. failure to comply with data protection laws can also result in civil, criminal, and financial sanctions for rentokil initial and individuals. n only use personal data for clear business reasons in accordance with relevant legislation and the above principles. n store personal data securely. n immediately report to the group data protection & legal compliance officer any data breaches of which they become aware. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the data protection policy under core group policies on the ri intranet. the data protection material in the group legal section of the ri intranet also provides useful guidance. speak you can speak to your manager, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: for how long should i keep a job applicantâs details on file? a: 12 months should be sufficient, unless a longer period is required under local law. you can also refer to the document and data retention policy, under group legal, data privacy guidance on the ri intranet. (newline)  (newline) 11 code of conduct doing business ethically code of conduct (newline)  (newline) 12 code of conduct bribery and corruption we have a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. bribery, a form of corruption, is harmful and illegal, and we must not engage in it in any way. bribery means giving, offering, receiving, or requesting a corrupt or improper payment or advantage in exchange for something in return. examples of situations in which pressure to pay a bribe might arise: n to win or keep a contract. n to obtain a certificate or permit. n to secure payment of an invoice. n to avoid a fine or penalty. n to clear goods through customs. n to gain an advantage over a competitor. a bribe could consist of something of value such as money, gifts, entertainment, services, employment, charitable donations, political contributions, preferable treatment, or some other advantage. small extra payments to individuals for the performance of routine government or official actions (also known as âfacilitationâ or âgreaseâ payments) are a type of bribery and therefore equally prohibited. there may be very rare exceptions, usually in an emergency, where such payments are required such as if a colleagueâs safety is threatened. seek advice before considering making such a payment. meals, hospitality, and small gifts can be legitimate activities when conducted appropriately. however, they could be a form of bribery if they are excessive in value, inappropriate in nature, too frequent, or intended to have an improper influence on a business decision. all such activities must be carried out in accordance with the gifts and hospitality policy and travel and expenses policy for the relevant business. if a third party who is acting for us, such as a supplier or agent, pays a bribe then we could be held liable as if we paid it ourselves. we do not want contracts with customers who seek bribes as that kind of business is unethical, illegal, and unsustainable. we must therefore avoid working with people or organisations which engage in corrupt practices. any association with bribery, wherever it happens in the world, would be likely to cause severe damage to our reputation and could have serious legal and financial repercussions. for our staff, bribery constitutes serious misconduct which would result in disciplinary actions, up to and including dismissal, and possible criminal proceedings. n stay up-to-date with training on this topic. n never give, offer, accept or request a bribe in any form, directly or indirectly. n be particularly careful when dealing with any kind of government or public official, and do not offer them anything of value without clear approval to do so. n only give or accept appropriate gifts and entertainment in line with the relevant gifts and hospitality policy, and ensure that they are recorded. n carry out appropriate checks on our suppliers, ensure they are aware of and agree to comply with our supplier code of conduct and anti-bribery & corruption policy, and enter into written contracts with them that contain anti-bribery obligations. n if unsure whether anything may constitute a bribe, err on the side of caution and seek advice. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the anti-bribery & corruption policy on www.rentokil-initial.com and group legal guidance on the ri intranet, as well as the gifts and hospitality section on page 26. speak you can speak to your manager, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: iâve been asked to pay a rebate to a customer to secure the renewal of a large contract. this is not referred to anywhere in the contract terms, but itâs a very valuable contract for a key customer. what should i do? a: do not pay it and seek advice. this sounds like an illegitimate payment request. (newline)  (newline) 13 code of conduct trade controls and sanctions we are committed to operating in compliance with all applicable trade controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations. trade controls and sanctions may prohibit some or all business activities within certain countries and/or with specific individuals or entities. violation of these controls can have serious consequences, including significant fines and/or imprisonment. to ensure we abide by applicable controls and sanctions requirements, we have a policy and guidance to assist our colleagues in understanding the specific requirements relating to their business and functional activities. examples of activities that could result in non-compliance findings: n providing goods or services to, or doing business with individuals, entities, or countries that are subject to sanctions, including merger & acquisition activities. n engaging in or facilitating transactions or business activities that involve individuals, entities, or countries that are subject to sanctions. n making payment to or receiving payments from individuals, entities, or countries that are subject to sanctions. n engaging in any activity that could contribute to the evasion of sanctions. n providing false or misleading information to relevant authorities in relation to sanctions compliance. we are committed to conducting our business in an ethical and legal manner, and complying with all applicable trade and sanctions laws and regulations is a key part of this commitment. by doing so, we honour our vision to be the most loved and respected services business on the planet â delivering in the right way. n understand and comply with applicable laws and policies related to trade controls and sanctions. n always record international transactions accurately and completely. n recognise that the laws of more than one country may apply to a particular transaction. n contact your local legal team if you have one or group legal if you ever have questions about a particular transaction. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the sanctions policy and accompanying guidance on the intranet, under group legal, legal compliance. speak you can speak to your manager, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: weâve found that a potential customer is on a sanctions list in another country, but they arenât sanctioned in the country providing the services. is it okay for us to pursue a business relationship and contract with them? a: probably not. several sanctions regimes restrict dealings related to certain persons and entities, so even if they are located in countries other than the sanctioned jurisdiction, the sanctions can still apply. if you donât find the answer you need from the policy and related guidance, contact group legal for help. (newline)  (newline) 14 code of conduct competition and antitrust we must compete fairly and lawfully wherever we operate. it is critical to our success that we compete for and win business from customers. however, rentokil initial expects all of its businesses to compete in the marketplace in a manner that is lawful, ethical, and allows for healthy competition. most countries have laws prohibiting anti-competitive behaviour and regulate dealings between competitors, customers, suppliers, and distributors. generally, this means we cannot engage in behaviour that might restrict competition and/or distort the market, such as price fixing, market sharing, sharing of confidential/sensitive information, and bid rigging with competitors. if your business is a market leader or has a high market share, it could be treated as having a dominant market position in which case even stricter provisions would likely apply to prevent your business from abusing its position, like aggressively seeking to drive competitors out of business. these laws vary around the world and some, such as in the us and eu, can apply even when the conduct occurs outside the relevant territory. penalties for breaching competition law can be severe and could expose rentokil initial, and even individuals, to: n significant civil and criminal sanctions, including huge fines and prison sentences. n investigations and legal proceedings. n reputational damage and loss of business. n stay up-to-date with training on this topic and familiarise themselves with applicable laws in their market. if in doubt, seek advice. n compete rigorously but fairly, on the basis of the quality and other merits of our services and products. n treat all customers fairly on price, terms, and services we offer them. n ensure any meetings held with competitors are for a lawful purpose, such as trade association meetings to discuss legitimate issues affecting the industry as a whole. n follow the trade association policy should they wish to attend trade association meetings. n leave any meetings or end conversations that raise any anti-competitive issues and immediately inform their manager or legal team/group legal. n if our business is dominant in its market, ensure it does nothing that could be construed as abusing its dominant position or unfairly trying to reduce competition. n ensure they do not share any commercially-sensitive information with competitors. n gather market intelligence through legitimate means. n seek advice before collaborating with a competitor (including as their customer or supplier) and ensure any information exchanged is strictly limited to what is required for that particular transaction. n take care in any communications, especially in writing, regarding market shares and any other sensitive information. inaccurate statements of our market share could be used against us if we were ever investigated. n never engage in any contact with competitors where prices, costs, margins, commercial contract terms, markets, or customers are discussed. n never agree with competitors, directly or indirectly, to fix prices or other contract terms or to divide up markets, territories, or customers. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the rentokil initial competition law policy and the rentokil initial trade association policy under core group policies on the ri intranet. speak you can speak to your manager, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: a competitor suggests that we coordinate responses to two tenders so we each stand a good chance of winning one. is this the âwin-winâ situation he suggests? a: no this would be illegal bid rigging. we must decide our responses to all tenders independently. (newline)  (newline) 15 code of conduct accurate reporting, accounts and records it is essential we record and report all information accurately and honestly. all colleagues must ensure accurate and honest recording and reporting of information in order to conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the companyâs system of internal controls. this applies to all information relevant to our business, including our annual report, monthly management accounts, sales figures, contracts, and personal expenses claims, as well as non-financial information such as health and safety reports and supplier audits. our financial and accounting records are relied upon by our management, directors, investors, and the public to make informed decisions about our business and may also be provided to regulatory and governmental authorities. we must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, accounting standards, and our own accounting policies, and ensure the financial information we produce provides a true and fair view of our business and is not in any way misleading. revenue and profit figures must be accurate and recognised in the correct period in line with the requirements of applicable accounting standards. any material areas of judgement or subjectivity must be agreed upon with group accounting. all sales and customer contracts must be appropriately documented and correctly recorded in the relevant contract-administration system. all business expenses must be accurately recorded and supported by documentation. if a colleague is not sure if an expense is legitimate, they should refer it to their manager. n ensure all our books, records, data, and accounts are accurate and complete. n never artificially inflate sales or profit figures, or falsely move them between reporting periods. n never make any false or misleading entry into any report, record, or expense claim. n be vigilant for any fraud or misreporting and immediately report any concerns. n never create or use any undisclosed, âoff the booksâ or âghostâ accounts, contracts or funds. n record and document all transactions appropriately. n follow all applicable rentokil initial accounting policies and procedures and comply with all relevant laws, regulations, and standards. n ensure all control procedures are rigorously applied and fully documented in line with our documented internal control framework. all colleagues are expected to: q&as for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the group accounting policies in the central finance section of the group intranet. speak you can speak to your finance team. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: iâve noticed that sales seems to invoice additional sales at the end of each quarter, some of which is re-credited at the beginning of the following quarter. what should i do? a: if you are concerned, you should raise the issue with your manager or finance team. q: my manager has asked me to pay for a dinner with customers which both of us attended and to claim it back through expenses. what should i do? a: the most senior colleague present should pay for meals or entertainment and should have it authorised by their line manager. it is not acceptable to ask junior colleagues to pay for expenses where the purpose of doing so is to circumvent obtaining appropriate approval. q: my sales manager says heâs agreed to a big sale with a customer which should be included in this yearâs figure, but the âpaperworkâ wonât be signed until january. can i include it? a: the contract needs to be finalised and signed before the revenue can be booked, so you should not include it unless that can all be in place by the end of the year.

(newline)  (newline) 18 code of conduct community, charitable and political activity we respect our local communities. we understand we have a responsibility to play a positive role in our local communities. rentokil initial assists where possible the involvement of colleagues in the cultural, educational, and social development of the communities in which the company operates and its employees live. as an organisation, we make corporate donations and raise funds for various charitable causes. it is important that any charitable contributions on behalf of the company are properly authorised and should not be used to gain improper advantage. the company encourages personal charitable giving, particularly where its employees take an active role, and has a matched-giving scheme to support colleaguesâ efforts. as a non-political organisation, rentokil initial will refrain from making any contribution, whether in cash or kind, to any political candidate, party, or organisation whose activities are designed to promote the interests of political parties or political ideologies. the company and all of its colleagues are part of society wherever it operates and in all societies, matters relating to politics play an important role for both businesses and individuals. from time to time political subjects of legitimate interest and importance to the company may arise. only properly authorised personnel may engage in any communication that might be considered as participating in the political process (including political lobbying). see page 23. colleagues, in their personal capacity, are free to participate in any community, charitable, trade union, or political activity of their choice on an individual basis, with their own money and in their own time, but this must not interfere with their work for the company, create a conflict of interest, or bring the company into disrepute. colleagues should be careful to ensure any such activity could not be interpreted as being on behalf of, or connected with, our business (unless it is previously authorised). n respect the communities in which we operate and be sensitive to culture and customs. n obtain any necessary approvals, in accordance with the group authority schedule, prior to agreeing to make any charitable donations on behalf of rentokil initial. n never make any charitable contributions that are, or could be construed as, for the purposes of seeking a business or personal advantage or influence. n never make any political donations or engage in any political process on behalf of rentokil initial without prior approval, in accordance with the group authority schedule. n keep personal, political, and charitable activities separate from work activities. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the community involvement policy on www.rentokil-initial.com and see the rentokil initial cares section on the ri intranet. speak you can speak to your manager or the corporate communications team. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: a customer has requested that we provide financial support to a local charity and has suggested that if we donât we may lose business. what should i do? a: you should raise the matter with your managing director. it is not acceptable for such support to be provided to avoid losing business as this would be a bribe. (newline)  (newline) 19 code of conduct protecting our organisation code of conduct (newline)  (newline) 20 code of conduct contracts the business contracts we enter into must be authorised and observed properly. contracts define our business relationships with customers, suppliers, and other third parties with whom we do business. they are an important means of managing risks by setting out each partyâs obligations, providing clarity as to how the relationship should work and limiting our exposure if things go wrong. it is also critical we fully observe all of our duties and obligations contained in those contracts to preserve the companyâs commercial success and maintain its reputation. for customer contracts, we have a customer contracts minimum standards policy that sets out details of the minimum standard requirements in our contracts, as well as commentary on our standard contracting clauses. it is designed to help guide contract negotiators on internal policy regarding what can and cannot be amended by negotiation, and explanations of the purpose and importance of clauses. it should be read with the group authority schedule on financial and other key risk clauses (e.g., unlimited liability) and the escalation process to get approvals for exceptions to the standard arrangements. there is a separate group procurement policy which must be followed for all dealings with suppliers of products or services, along with the supplier code, which aligns the standards expected of our suppliers with those set out in this code. n follow the customer contracts minimum standards policy when negotiating and entering customer contracts. n observe the rentokil initial procurement policy and supplier code for supplier contracts. n follow the group authority schedule. n ensure all agreed terms are properly documented in writing. n not agree to carry out any unauthorised business activity or provide services in a territory outside our footprint without the appropriate group approval. n ensure that contracts and their terms are reviewed and approved at the appropriate level, in accordance with the group authority schedule. n familiarise themselves with, and observe, the terms of any contracts applicable to our activities. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the customer contracts minimum standards policy, group procurement policy, supplier code, and the group authority schedule on the ri intranet. speak you can speak to your manager, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: a key customer asked me if we can sort out some repairs to their roof, which i noticed needed doing. this is not what we normally do but we can find someone who could, which would keep the customer happy and avoid them going to a competitor. is this ok? a: we must not carry out unauthorised activities without specific authorisation from group. there are several reasons for this, including she risks, whether we would be insured, whether we have the appropriate license, and the damage it could cause to the customer and our reputation if something went wrong. (newline)  (newline) 21 code of conduct company assets and confidential information colleagues must protect and not misuse company property and confidential information. all company assets, whether physical or intangible, must only be used for legitimate and authorised business purposes. theft, misuse, and carelessness have a direct impact on the companyâs profitability. physical property and it resources rentokil initial provides tools, products, and equipment for carrying out our work which should never be used for personal use or profit. the company also gives access to it resources, such as pcs, laptops, handheld devices, mobile phones, email, and the internet for business purposes. limited and occasional personal use of company it resources is permitted, provided it does not interfere with colleague productivity or performance of his or her duties, or adversely impact the reputation of the company. at all times, the use of the companyâs it resources must comply with the companyâs acceptable use policy. suspected misuse of company equipment, systems, or data will be investigated and could result in disciplinary action being taken, which may include dismissal. intellectual property and confidential information the obligation of all colleagues to protect the companyâs assets includes its intellectual property, such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and copyright material, including customer lists and operating manuals as well as other business and marketing material, ideas, designs, databases, records, or any unpublished financial data and reports. a considerable proportion of the value of the group is represented by intellectual property rights and all colleagues have a responsibility to protect these important assets. colleagues must not use the companyâs confidential information in an inappropriate manner, either for personal gain or to provide an unfair advantage to a third party. all non-public information about the company is confidential information and should be kept secure and not be discussed with or disclosed in any way to any external parties. this confidential information includes details of customers and suppliers, the way the company operates its services, and how the companyâs products are manufactured or purchased. in the case of required disclosure of information to third parties, such as advisers and business partners, there must be contractual arrangements in place containing clear rules on the non-disclosure of information. n be vigilant for any misuse or theft of company resources and report any concerns. n avoid improper use of company assets, such as using work phones for excessive personal calls. n ensure leavers return all company property in their possession before they leave, including customer lists and operating manuals. n follow all best practices and policies for it security and stay up-to-date with training on the subject. n be discreet when discussing or working on confidential matters. n enter an appropriate confidentiality agreement (also known as a non-disclosure agreement or nda) before making confidential information available to third parties. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the acceptable use and information security policies on the ri intranet. speak you can speak to your manager, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: one of my team members left to join a competitor and iâm worried he took details of our customers with him. what can i do? a: report your suspicions to your manager and/or local hr, your local legal team if you have one or group legal. we can investigate and if necessary follow up with him and his new employer. we may take legal action for breach of confidentiality and breach of his employment contract terms. in some circumstances we may need to inform regulators or customers. q: what obligations apply to other companiesâ information that we come across? a: we must apply similar standards of protection to the confidential information of third parties as we should to our own. (newline)  (newline) 22 code of conduct fraud and money laundering we all have a role to play in preventing fraud and money laundering. rentokil initial is committed to preventing fraud and to maintaining an appropriate anti\u0002fraud culture, which is why the company has a zero-tolerance approach to fraud. fraud can potentially seriously damage the companyâs reputation, as well as expose individuals and the company to legal proceedings. no colleague should knowingly permit the carrying out of any fraudulent act by a business or another colleague in connection with the running of a rentokil initial business. any conduct that could potentially be fraudulent will result in an investigation that could lead to disciplinary action being taken against the offending party, which may result in dismissal. any concerns should be reported promptly to your manager or by using any of the ways set out in the advice and reporting concerns section on page 29. examples and potential indicators of fraud: n setting up false records of sales or contracts. n excessive use of write offs or credit notes. n âmoonlightingâ or secretly conducting rentokil initial services for personal payment. n request for changes to supplier or colleague bank account information. n forgeries or unauthorised alteration of documents. n payment or receipt of unusually high or low prices. n payments made for unclear reasons. n fictitious expenses. any incidents or suspicions of fraud committed against rentokil initial by external parties should be reported to your finance or legal team. do not request or authorise any payments where you suspect fraud could be involved. all colleagues must guard against money laundering: money laundering is the process whereby criminals attempt to hide or disguise the true origin and ownership of the proceeds of their criminal activities, thereby avoiding prosecution, conviction, and confiscation of the criminal funds. âtipping offâ anyone who may be attempting to commit a crime under the money laundering rules can also be a criminal offence. money laundering crimes can result in a colleague personally being subject to criminal sanctions and company disciplinary measures. circumstances that may indicate money laundering include a customer or other party being unwilling to provide personal information, wishing to pay large amounts in cash, being unconcerned about the amount they need to pay, using multiple accounts or payment methods, or using an account based in an unexpected location. n immediately report any potential fraud or other dishonest activity they become aware of or have suspicions about. n be cooperative, open and honest in any fraud investigation. n be alert to the possibility of fraud being committed within rentokil initial or by external parties and act on any suspicions. if something does not seem right then seek advice. n follow all best practice and advice issued in relation to preventing fraud attempts such as phishing emails. n be alert to circumstances or behaviour which could suggest money laundering and discuss any concerns with their finance team or group treasury. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the bribery and corruption section on page 12 and accurate reporting, accounts and records on page 15. speak you can speak to your manager, finance team, internal audit, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: i suspect a colleague might be involved in fraudulent behaviour. i want to report it, but i also want to avoid any personal repercussions. what should i do? a: there are a number of ways you can report this. you could speak to your manager or another senior colleague, contact your local legal team (if any) or group legal, inform the internal audit team or raise the issue by email or telephone through our anonymous reporting service speak up â see page 29 for further details. we will not tolerate any retaliation against people who, in good faith, report suspected ethical or legal misconduct or policy violations.

procedures to assess and address the risk of modern slavery (including child labor) apply to our operations and supply chains worldwide. this statement describes the actions taken by amazon.com, inc. and its covered subsidiaries (hereafter collectively referred to as âamazonâ)1 during the period from january 1, 2023 to december 31, 2023.2 the statement has been prepared in compliance with the requirements of the australia modern slavery act 2018,3 the california transparency in supply chains act 2010, canadaâs fighting against forced labour and child labour in supply chains act 2023,4 and the united kingdom modern slavery act 2015. amazon is committed to treating our own employees and people who are connected to our business with fundamental dignity and respect; and this includes a commitment to freely chosen employment. we do not tolerate any form of modern slavery. for the purposes of this statement, we use the term modern slavery to mean child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking in any form - including slave labor, prison labor, indentured servitude, or bonded labor. the fight against modern slavery requires a holistic approach, including commitment, resources, and innovative solutions from governments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society. at amazon, we understand the unique responsibility of the private sector in these efforts and are committed to expanding our work to understand and address modern slavery risks that may arise in the course of our business. in 2023, we actively engaged with diverse stakeholders, including industry associations, non-governmental organizations, suppliers, and other companies, to strengthen our efforts to identify, prevent, and address the risk of all forms of modern slavery in our operations and business relationships. we helped increase our suppliersâ awareness and understanding of our supply chain standards through trainings, workshops, and resources, updated our modern slavery training available to amazon employees, and introduced a new way for members of the public to notify us about human rights concerns. we enhanced our partnerships with industry associations and non-profit organizations to further develop best practices in addressing risks of modern slavery. we are committed to continuously improving our approach to, and policies surrounding, prevention of modern slavery. this statement assesses our risk, outlines our efforts, and sets commitments for the coming year. 1 this statement excludes any entity that elects to report independently. 2 metrics

(newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 4 our business amazon is a global company, headquartered in washingtonâs puget sound region and arlington, virginia, in the united states, with approximately 1.5 million full- and part-time employees worldwide and operations in africa, asia-pacific, europe, united kingdom, latin america, the middle east, and north america. we offer products and servicesâboth ama\u0002zon-branded and from many other brands and third\u0002party sellersâin our amazon stores, leveraging advanced transportation logistics to deliver globally. we also create entertainment content and, through amazon web services (aws), provide cloud services. our operations are organized into three segments: north america, international, and aws. in each of our segments we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enter\u0002prises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. we procure materials, commodities, components, finished goods, and services from a complex supplier network. our global supply chains consist of a broad assortment of both direct and indirect suppliers who provide a diverse range of products and services, including, but not limited to, finished products, raw materials, packaging materials, logistics, and transportation services. our logistics and fulfill\u0002ment network relies on a combination of suppliers of non-inventory goods (e.g., packaging and labels, robotics and equipment), and on- and off-site service providers, including delivery partners. for example, amazon-branded digital devices (kindle, fire tv, fire tablet, ring, and echo) have a raw and recovered materials supply chain that is a complex system of sellers, buyers, traders, producers, processors, and manufacturers across multiple tiers and sourcing regions around the world. for these devices, supply chain categories include facilities and suppliers involved in the final assembly of amazon devices and component manufacturing, reverse logistics, minerals and metals, and plastics and synthetics. for more information on the supply chain for amazon devices, please see a summary of our human rights impact assessment for amazon devices. we serve consumers through our online and physical stores.5 we design our stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, alexa, devices, streaming, and by physically visiting our stores. we also manufacture and sell electronic devices, and we develop and produce media content. in addition, we offer subscrip\u00025 in 2023, we operated physical stores in the uk and the us. tion services such as amazon prime, a membership program that includes fast, free shipping on millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series, and other benefits. we fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: north america and international fulfillment networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. we operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. we offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. we are not the seller of record in these transactions. we earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, from our seller programs. we serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions through aws, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. we offer programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. with operations and supply chains spanning the globe, amazon is committed to improving the working conditions of people who are connected to our business, and we recognize the need to monitor for conditions that put workers at risk of modern slavery. more information about amazon can be found in our most recent sustainability report, annual report, and our latest proxy statement. our governance amazon is committed to embedding respect for human rights throughout our business activities and relationships, including into our policy and governance framework. amazonâs board of directors is responsi\u0002ble for the control and direction of amazon. the full board regularly reviews reports from management on various aspects of our business, including related risks and strategies for addressing them. while the full board has overall responsibility for risk oversight, the board has delegated responsibility for certain risks to the nominating and corporate governance committee. (newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 5 the boardâs nominating and corporate governance committee oversees and monitors amazonâs policies and initiatives relating to corporate social responsi\u0002bility, including human rights and ethical business practices, and risks related to amazonâs operations and engagement with customers, suppliers, and communities. for more information on the responsibilities of the nominating and corporate governance committee, please see our most recent sustainability report and investor relations website. our policies our efforts to assess and address risks of modern slavery across our business and supply chains are anchored in our policies. our policies convey our values and expectations, setting a high bar for ourselves, our suppliers, and our selling partners,6 making clear we do not tolerate modern slavery. we regularly review our strategies, principles, and supporting policies to identify opportunities for improvement. by engaging external stakeholders and monitoring evolving international and human rights standards, regulations, and industry best practices, we are able to effectively and continuously improve our own policies and standards to better support our employees and our suppliers.7 global human rights principles our global human rights principles demonstrate our commitment to respecting fundamental human rights and the dignity of people connected to our business around the world. we are committed to ensuring that the products and services we provide are produced in a way that respects human rights, including the right to freely chosen employment. our global human rights principles also state that we do not tolerate the use of child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking in any formâincluding slave labor, prison labor, indentured servitude, or bonded laborâin our operations or value chain. these principles are informed by leading international standards and frameworks developed by the united nations (un) and the international labour organiza\u0002tion (ilo). amazon is committed to respecting and supporting the un guiding principles on business and human rights (ungps), the un universal dec\u0002laration of human rights, the core conventions of the ilo, and the ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work. 6 selling partners are vendors and third-party sellers that sell or supply products and services in amazonâs stores. 7 we update our global human rights principles at least every five years and our supply chain standards at least every three years. our latest update to the supply chain standards was published in 2022. code of business conduct and ethics our code of business conduct and ethics (code of conduct), associated policies, procedures, training, and communications outline our expectations of our employees. all employees receive code of conduct training during onboarding, with regular refresher training thereafter. amazon provides its employees various secure and accessible channels with guidelines for reporting concerns and violations. employees can reach out to anyone in their management chain or the legal department with questions about the application of the code of conduct or how to approach difficult workplace situations. employees may also make reports online or via phone through the amazon ethics line, which is managed by an independent third party, and remain anonymous on request. the ethics line is currently available in more than 60 countries in 165 languages. any employee can also email suggestions or complaints to senior leadership. all escalations are reviewed by human resources and may inform process updates to prevent future gaps. we prohibit retaliation and take all allegations seriously. our business conduct and ethics team records, investigates (or directs others to investigate), reports alleged violations of the code of conduct to the audit committee of the board, and tracks any remediation required. employees must cooperate in internal investigations of potential or alleged misconduct, with those who violate the code of conduct subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge. supply chain standards publicly available in 21 languages and dialects and derived from relevant international standards and frameworks, our supply chain standards (also referred to as âour standardsâ) are the backbone to our efforts to enable a responsible supply chain. our supply chain standards apply to suppliers of goods and services for amazon and amazonâs subsidiaries, including providers, vendors, selling partners, contractors, and subcontractors (collec\u0002tively âsuppliersâ). all products sold in amazon stores, and all products and services provided to amazon, must be produced or provided in accordance with our supply chain standards. suppliers are required to conform to our standards and must follow all applicable laws and regulations. when applicable law conflicts with our standards, suppliers must follow the law while finding ways to respect the principles of internationally recognized human rights and the expectations contained in the standards. we encourage suppliers to perform human rights and (newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 6 environmental due diligence to ensure their products and services are produced and supplied in ways that respect human rights and the environment and protect the fundamental dignity of workers. our supply chain standards mandate that all workers must be treated with respect and dignity. suppliers must not engage in or tolerate violence, harassment, abuse, or coercion, including physical, verbal, sexual, or psychological, or any form of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. our supply chain standards require that all work must be voluntary and workers must be free to leave work and terminate their employment or other work status with reasonable notice, without penalty. suppliers must not cause workers to lose possession of or access to their personal documents. before they enter into employment or prior to departing their country of origin, workers must be given clear, under\u0002standable documentation that defines the terms and conditions of their employment in a language and manner they understand, with preference for each workerâs native or best understood language and/or visual images for workers with lower literacy levels. amazonâs supply chain standards recognize domestic and foreign migrant workersâ unique vul\u0002nerability to risks of exploitation and make clear that workers may not be charged fees at any point in the recruitment process. we expect our suppliers to analyze and monitor the practices of recruitment agencies and labor brokers and to employ agencies that act ethically and in the best interests of workers. in cases where remediation measures are taken, we will consider whether additional steps are necessary to address the income loss experienced by the most vulnerable families impacted by these measures. in addition, our standards require suppliers to engage workers who are: (i) at least 15 years old, (ii) the age of completion of compulsory education, or (iii) the minimum age to work in the country where work is performed, whichever is greater. workers under the age of 18 (âyoung workersâ) must not perform hazardous work, including that which is likely to jeopardize their health or safety, or work that compromises their education (e.g., night shifts, overtime). if cases of child labor are identified our standards mandate remediation, including through corrective measures that facilitate the childâs safety and wellbeing. assessing our risk understanding our modern slavery risk is critical to our actions and partnerships to prevent and address the issue. amazonâs centralized team of experts work across the company to conduct human rights and environmental due diligence. through this work, amazon takes steps to assess and prioritize risks, takes action to address and mitigate identified risks, measures progress, and remediates harm when issues occur. in line with the ungps, identifying and prioritizing the most salient risks, including with respect to modern slavery, connected to amazon operations and business relationships is central to our human rights due diligence practices. as we continuously improve and expand these practices, we use human rights assessment methodologies to identify and mitigate human rights risks. these assessments help us understand the causes of systemic issues, enhance ongoing engagement with critical stake\u0002holders, implement the right risk-based mitigation measures, and refine strategies for ongoing risk management across our supply chain. examples of human rights assessment methodologies include: â¢ human rights saliency assessments, which focus risk management action and remediation on the most severe risks relevant to a companyâs business activity. â¢ human rights impact assessments (hrias), which examine a particular business segment or product, a country of operation or sourcing, a potentially affected group, or other human rights risk areas for a specific subset of a busi\u0002ness. â¢ human rights due diligence management as\u0002sessments, which analyze a businessâs internal capacity to assess and respond to human rights risks. these assessments allow us to identify salient risks, build capacity and business-level ownership aligned to those risks, and conduct targeted human rights and environmental due diligence to monitor and manage compliance. for more information about our 2020 enter\u0002prise-wide human rights saliency assessment, our human rights risks, and our human rights assess\u0002ments, please see our 2023 sustainability report. 8 our modern slavery risk assessment practices are informed by: vulnerable groups modern slavery experts and leading non-govern\u0002mental organizations play a key role in helping us identify modern slavery risks associated with our supply chain and operations. while modern slavery can impact any population, we recognize certain groups are particularly vulnerable, including: 8 the concept of salience uses the lens of risk to people, not the business, as the starting point, while recognizing that where risks to peopleâs human rights are greatest, there is often strong convergence with risk to the busi\u0002ness. united nations guiding principles reporting framework. (newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 7 â¢ domestic and foreign migrant workers â¢ contract, agency, and temporary workers â¢ refugees, asylum seekers, ethnic/religious mi\u0002norities, and displaced persons â¢ young or student workers â¢ indigenous peoples region-specific risk even though modern slavery can be found in all countries, we take into account region-spe\u0002cific risks. based on globally accepted risk indices such as the world bankâs worldwide governance indicators, the global slavery index, and those issued by the us department of labor, ilo, and unicef, we understand that certain countries may present higher risks for modern slavery; for example, countries with large populations of migrant workers, with weaker labor law enforcement, where charging workers recruitment fees is common practice, or where modern slavery prevalence has been well documented. we use a risk-based approach tailored to the regional context to identify country-specific risks and implement site-level requirements to help build local suppliersâ capacity to meet our standards. in countries identified as higher-risk, we mandate participation in better work - a joint program of the ilo and the international finance corporation (a member of the world bank group) - that works directly with factories, workers, and their represen\u0002tatives to support greater compliance with national labor laws and international labor standards through assessments, training, advocacy, and research. where better work is unavailable, we require par\u0002ticipation in an amazon-managed audit. alongside these targeted interventions, we participate in and offer our suppliers a wide array of central and local capacity-building programs. these enable suppliers to develop their in-house capabilities and improve social compliance performance. we continually review our supply chain footprint to evaluate where additional due diligence, partnership, and collabora\u0002tion are needed. our supply chain we understand that our supply chains, including for our amazon-branded products,9 present a need for focused efforts to assess the risk of modern slavery. we prioritize the protection of human rights within our supply chain and regularly engage suppliers on key human rights issues. we routinely evaluate our supply chains to understand the highest risks to workers and prioritize our efforts to address both 9 amazon-branded products are apparel, consumer electronics, food and beverage, and home good products such as amazon basics, amazon devices (e.g., kindle, fire tv, echo) or other private labels owned by amazon. this includes any product manufactured or co-manufactured by amazon, including its subsidiaries. site-specific challenges and broader, systemic risks. we require suppliers to continuously monitor and enforce our supply chain standards in their own operations and supply chain, including with sub\u0002contractors. suppliers are encouraged to self-eval\u0002uate and make improvements to meet or exceed our expectations and those of our customers as reflected in our standards. we encourage suppliers to continuously assess their risks specific to groups that may be more vulnerable to exploitation, including women, children, indigenous peoples, and temporary or migrant workers. for both our operationsâ non-inventory products and services and our amazon-branded products, we engage with internal and external stakehold\u0002ers, evaluate country- and industry-level risks, and conduct regular risk assessments that include worker and management interviews, document reviews, and on-site visits and audits. for our amazon-branded products, we also regularly consult industry experts to review our approach to risk assessment against globally recognized international standards and industry best practices. audits are conducted for suppliers who manufacture products that are amazon-branded and who provide services (e.g., staffing agencies, janitorial companies) or not-for-resale goods in our operations. we assess these suppliers globally during onboarding and peri\u0002odically thereafter to evaluate their compliance with our supply chain standards. auditors conduct regular site inspections, confidential worker interviews or surveys, and review and analyze site documents or licenses. when an audit finding requires a more hands-on approach, we also send amazon teams or third-party experts to conduct further assess\u0002ments. we assess suppliers against modern slavery indicators, for example where an employer does not communicate the full terms of employment, does not give clear documentation defining those terms in a language the worker understands, does not give required notice of overtime, collects recruitment and related fees that can lead to debt bondage, or takes a workerâs identification document. to date, we have focused our efforts on our products supply chains. however, over the past two years, we increased our investments in identifying and addressing the highest risks across the supply chains related to our own operations. at the supplier site level, we look for modern slavery indicators that can suggest heightened risk, including the presence of workers who are part of vulnerable populations, a supplierâs failure to deliver on a promised term of employment, restriction of worker movement, a supplierâs retention of identity documents, and debt bondage indicators, such as charging recruitment fees or mandatory overtime. this data informs our (newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 8 efforts to respond to those risks. as described in further detail below, we are developing regional and country-level strategies tailored to specific social, cultural, economic, and regulatory contexts and have ongoing due diligence in place to address these risks. addressing our risk we aim consistently to deliver progress and expand our work to understand and address any modern slavery risks that may arise in the course of our business. â¦with our suppliers of amazon-branded prod\u0002ucts we support our suppliers to meet our standards. amazon continuously works to make its suppliers aware of our supply chain standards and supports their efforts to build the skills and mechanisms to meet them. we have dedicated teams in key sourcing regions that engage directly with suppliers to com\u0002municate our supply chain standards. we also con\u0002tinuously monitor regulations in the countries where we operate and actively engage with our teams and suppliers to meet new regulatory requirements. throughout our relationship with our suppliers, we provide resources and training to help them strengthen their ability to respect human rights within their own workplace and supply chain. in 2023, we hosted in-person and online training events on our supply chain standards. we also launched a new in-person peer-learning workshop series that convenes factory management to hear from industry experts and share best practices for addressing common challenges in bangladesh, cambodia, china, malaysia, saudi arabia, singapore, taiwan, thailand, and the united arab emirates. we are building efforts to amplify the voice of workers in our supply chain. we want all workers in our supply chain to have the ability to voice their concerns in a safe and confidential manner. to do this, we connect suppliers and service providers with trusted tools, products, and systems to hear directly from workers about their experience and support the resolution of issues from workersâ perspectives. with these mechanisms, suppliers can gather feedback directly from workers to inform more effective issue resolution. in 2023, we helped connect supplier sites across bangladesh, cambodia, china, india, malaysia, pakistan, and thailand with independent grievance mechanisms. in 2023, we expanded the scope of our program to additional supplier segments across our operations supply chain. in japan, we partnered with the japan platform for migrant workers towards responsi\u0002ble and inclusive society (jp-mirai) so that certain suppliers in japan could provide their workers access to jp-miraiâs independent grievance mechanism. we continue to improve our responsible sourcing program for amazon-branded products. our responsible sourcing program works to reduce risks and help safeguard the rights of workers, especially those considered part of a vulnerable population or who work in countries associated with a higher modern slavery risk. supply chain transparency is a valuable tool to address risks in our supply chain and identify oppor\u0002tunities for collaboration on systemic supply chain issues. we publish a supplier list and interactive supply chain map with details on over 2,220 fin\u0002ished-product suppliers of amazon-branded apparel, consumer electronics, food and beverage, and home goods products. we also contribute this supplier list to the open supply hub to foster brand col\u0002laboration and action in the industry. open supply hub is an accessible, collaborative supply chain mapping platform, used and populated by stake\u0002holders across sectors and supply chains. in 2023, we leveraged the platformâs embedded map, which lists facilities producing amazon-branded products. the embedded map allows users to easily interact with facility data and have a transparent look into amazonâs supply chain. we provide data from supplier audits annually in our sustainability reporting, including year-over\u0002year data on high- and medium-level issues in our supply chain and actions to address our human rights risks. we engage in due diligence of suppliers of amazon-branded products. our supplier manual provides an overview of our due diligence processes. table 1: 2021, 2022, and 2023 related audit findings we accept audits completed by qualified indepen\u0002dent audit firms based on our own audit standards and those of industry associations, including sedex (smeta), amfori (amfori bsci), the responsible business alliance (rba), the certification standard social accountability international (sa8000), and the better work program. continued on next page (newline)

workers should be at the center of any remediation effort. we put the safety and interests of affected workers first. 10 audits are conducted for suppliers who manufacture products that are amazon-branded and who provide services (e.g., staffing agencies, janitorial compa\u0002nies) or not-for-resale goods in our operations. as explained further below, while we are conscious that audits are not the answer to all potential modern slavery risks, audits are one of the tools that help us determine where to focus our efforts and resources. we rely on our audit processes to provide us with important information about our responsible sourcing program so we can respond to the needs of workers making products that are amazon-branded. these insights help us tailor our programs and identify strategic partnerships, build supplier capacity, and address and prevent these issues. audits also help us detect an issue before we engage with suppliers or during our relationship with them so that we can work with suppliers to remedy the issue. when we identify a gap between a supplierâs practices and our supply chain standards, we track remediation and conduct follow-up assessments as needed. between assessments, our central team directly engages with suppliers to discuss open issues and remediation progress, and provides them with issue-specific remediation guidebooks. assessment findings are flagged as high, medium, or low depending on severity. when high- and medium- level issues are identified, we take steps to verify that suppliers have made meaningful progress toward remediation. failure to implement the actions listed in the corrective action plan may prevent the supplier from continuing production or providing services or labor to amazon. for low-level issues, we monitor suppliers for continuous improve\u0002ment through maintenance audits. for remediation plans, we expect suppliers to act within an agreed\u0002upon timeline, remove harm, act in the best interests of workers, and commit to preventing similar issues in the future. we operate with an approach based on continuous improvement, meaning we work with suppliers to embed respect for human rights in their operations and supply chain, to improve their practices to protect workers, and improve working conditions. when issues are identified, remediation can also be a challenge. for example, working with our suppliers to remediate worker-paid recruitment fees is particularly challenging in countries where payment of recruitment fees is a part of accepted business practice or an accepted part of government programs. if we terminate business with a supplier, we remove the incentive for the supplier to improve, which can have a detrimental effect on workers and the community. however, because improve\u0002ment is not always possible, we reserve the right to (newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 10 terminate a relationship at any time for failure to meet our supply chain standards. we track the results of our audits and remedia\u0002tion measures to assess their effectiveness, and continue to update our due diligence mechanisms to drive lasting change focused on benefiting workers in our supply chain. we are actively pursuing new mechanisms, technology solutions, and pilot programs to enhance our ability to pro\u0002actively identify and mitigate risks, and positively impact the well-being of workers. we also know we cannot address many of these complex issues alone; systemic issues contributing to modern slavery risks will require broader collaboration between govern\u0002ments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society. we develop materials and sponsor workshops to empower suppliers to strengthen their own management systems and contribute to industry association and multi-stakeholder initia\u0002tives working to address systemic issues. we continue to deepen our due diligence beyond our direct suppliers. commodity supply chains are com\u0002plicated and fragmented, and improved visibility into raw material supply chains better enables businesses to identify human rights and labor rights violations and hold suppliers accountable. responding to violations of our supply chain standards in saudi arabia in 2023, amazon found violations of our supply chain standards at a third-party licensed temporary labor agency (âthird-party vendorâ) in saudi arabia through an independent audit. the violations ranged from recruitment fees paid by migrant workers to the absence of grievance mechanisms and issues with worker accommo\u0002dations. external organizations raised similar concerns and shared information with us about these and other human rights risks collected during interviews with former employees of this third-party vendor. in response, we conducted a deeper dive into practices of our third-party vendors throughout saudi arabia and developed a series of short- and long-term measures to remedy immediate issues and prevent future recurrence. we involved two independent third parties to assist with our inves\u0002tigation and engaged directly with contracted workers through interviews and other means to help establish reimbursement amounts and manage repayment. as of february 2024, we have reimbursed more than 700 workers across all our third-party licensed temporary labor agencies in saudi arabia, totaling more than $1.9 million usd in reimbursed recruitment fees and related costs. through audits, we also verified that the third-party vendor remediated the most serious concerns about worker housing. we also secured the vendorâs commitment that after its employees cease working at amazon, it will pay its employees in line with their contracts and will not move them to a new accommodation site that fails to meet amazonâs standards. this vendor also established a more robust system to enable workers to anonymously raise grievances. we also adopted enhanced controls to reduce the risk of recurrence. among other measures related to third-party licensed temporary labor agencies in saudi arabia, we strengthened contracts to clarify expectations regarding compliance with our supply chain standards; reviewed wage policies, including clarification that illegal wage deductions are prohibited; provided additional training to vendors in the region on how to implement our supply chain standards, including responsible recruitment practices; and improved our communication mechanism that enables contracted workers to share concerns directly with amazonâs management. learn more about our response here. responsible mineral sourcing according to our supply chain standards, amazon suppliers should source commodities used in products in a way that respects local communities and protects ecosystems. suppliers should consis\u0002tently monitor the social and environmental per\u0002formance of their upstream suppliers in line with recognized due diligence frameworks. we recognize certain mineral supply chains are at higher risk of modern slavery. we conduct due diligence on high-risk minerals, including tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold, and cobalt, through our responsible minerals program. while amazon does not engage in direct sourcing from mine sites and smelters, we are committed to avoiding the use of minerals that have fueled conflict. we encourage our suppliers to support our effort to identify the origin of designated minerals used in our products consistent with recognized due diligence frameworks and source from smelters and refiners that have successfully completed a recognized third-party responsible minerals audit. our process for mapping and addressing our risks related to mineral sourcing can be found in our most recent conflict minerals report filed with the united states securities and exchange commission. we engage suppliers on the importance of responsible mineral sourcing mechanisms and industry collaboration. we are members of the (newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 11 to help promote better standards for cotton more widely, amazon sponsors and participates in the responsible sourcing network initiative yessâ¢: yarn ethically & sustainably sourced. yess supports fabric and spinning mills in implementing a risk-based due diligence approach for cotton sourcing, and promotes collaboration with the goal of preventing, mitigating, and remediating forced labor in cotton production. in 2023, yess launched its program to assess fabric and spinning mills in india and pakistan. amazon is supporting yessâs efforts to scale and to expand the program to vietnam and bangladesh. we continue to expand our responsible recruitment interventions. amazon is committed to addressing deceptive recruitment practices and payment of recruitment fees, which can be indicators of modern slavery. our responsible recruitment interventions aim at gaining greater visibility into supplier and employment agency recruitment practices, and at reducing the risk of forced labor in amazonâs supply chain. through increased due diligence and new strategic partnerships, we have deepened our understand\u0002ing of recruitment practices in different regions and industries. this work highlighted root causes of risks, particularly in origin and destination countries for foreign migrant workers. charging workers recruitment fees is not permitted under amazonâs supply chain standards. where fees were found to have been charged, we support our suppliers to understand ethical recruitment practices, create and implement remediation plans to reimburse workers (in full and in a manner that protects workers and their families from harm and retaliation), and build effective responsible recruitment systems to prevent recruitment fees from being charged to workers at any point in the hiring process. our responsible recruitment initiatives are structured around six core area: awareness raising; specialized training; case management support; risk assessment and mitigation toolkits; transparent data, analysis, and reporting; and partnerships. we offer suppliers on-site and remote support to help them understand amazon requirements, effec\u0002tively navigate the corrective action plan process, and design and implement sustainable management systems to encourage supplier monitoring throughout their supply chain. we support our suppliersâ efforts to establish data collection mechanisms, which facilitate the monitoring of progress and enable timely responses to emerging risks. we offer suppliers comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation toolkits to identify potential issues before these are surfaced during audits and allowing us to engage suppliers in a remediation process from the outset. in 2023, we launched a responsible recruit\u0002ment performance evaluation survey, consisting of a list of targeted questions to gather information on risks, controls, and recruitment agencies. where issues are identified, we offer suppliers dedicated case management support, which includes providing remediation guidebooks. for example, our recruit\u0002ment fee remediation guidebook, updated in 2023, provides suppliers with guidance on implementing a zero worker-paid recruitment fee policy, calculating fee repayment, creating effective reimbursement plans, and engaging responsible labor agents. the guidebook also includes sample language for terms of employment for clear communication between suppliers and workers. additionally, in 2023, we introduced a guidebook to assist suppliers in preventing and remediating the retention of identity documents. we believe providing suppliers with the right data, strategies, and tools helps them detect and address risks in their supply chains effectively. we encourage suppliers to participate in external training programs, such as industry association tutorials to recognize and prevent modern slavery and implement high-quality management systems. we also provide suppliers with responsible recruit\u0002ment training. in 2023, we extended our responsi\u0002ble recruitment training to our logistics and services providers and expanded offerings in additional countries that are common destinations for foreign migrant workers. working with the issara institute, microbenefits, the mekong club, and veritã©, we offered supplier training sessions on modern slavery risks and responsible recruitment practices in malaysia, saudi arabia, singapore, taiwan, thailand, and the united arab emirates. these sessions focused on topics including implementing effective risk mitigation controls, identifying issues in recruit\u0002ment and hiring processes for migrant workers, and establishing strong management systems to address and prevent these issues. human rights risks are systemic in nature; the key to addressing them is cross-industry engagement and collaboration. we engage with strategic partners responsible minerals initiative, the copper mark, and the public-private alliance for responsible minerals trade. through these partnerships, we collaborate with industry peers, governments, and civil society actors on increasing supply chain transparency and improve sourcing across mineral value chains. for more information on our responsible sourcing practices, please see our 2023 sustainability report.

exploitation they identify within our supply chain and business practices. â¦with aws our customers use aws technology to combat modern slavery. throughout 2023, we continued to partner closely with thorn, a non-profit that builds technology to combat child sexual abuse at scale. amazon provides millions of dollars in aws credits for thorn to power its tools. thorn leverages a variety of aws solutions to support safer, a solution that uses advanced ai and machine learning models to detect child sexual abuse material (csam) at scale. safer helps companies identify, review, and report csam from content-hosting platforms. in 2023, safer helped companies detect over 3.8 million csam files. we make thornâs safer technology available to businesses via the amazon web services (aws) marketplace so they can proactively identify and address csam. in the u.s., amazon collaborates with the national center for missing and exploited children (ncmec), a child protection organization committed to aiding the search for missing children, reducing child sexual exploitation, and preventing child victimiza\u0002tion. ncmec utilizes aws technology and services to support the infrastructure of several programs. amazonâs subsidiary ring works with ncmec to distribute geo-targeted missing child posters visible in the ring neighbors app and across social media. ncmecâs missing child posters encourage users to contact proper law enforcement or ncmec if they have information that could aid in the search for a missing child. amazon serves on ncmecâs board of directors and in 2023 provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in aws credits to reliably support mission-critical applications that assist ncmecâs mission of making sure that every child has a safe childhood. amazon supports polaris, a non-profit and aws customer that leads a survivor-centered, justice- and equity-driven movement to end human trafficking in the u.s. aws provides financial and technical support to enhance polarisâs data collection and operations and improve trafficking identification and prevention. since 2007, polaris has identified over 82,300 situations of human trafficking. â¦with other organizations amazon collaborates with ngos, governments, and other companies to reduce and disrupt modern slavery. amazon is a member of the steering committee for tech against trafficking (tat), a coalition of companies and global experts working to eradicate human trafficking using technology. building on the success of the inaugural tat summit, which was hosted in 2022, the 2023 summit, titled âleveraging technology to eradicate forced laborâ, brought together over 140 global anti-trafficking leaders, including businesses, civil society, academia, government, and survivors with lived experience. panelists and experts explored how technology can eradicate forced labor and labor trafficking and how companies like amazon can prevent the misuse of technology to facilitate these crimes. in 2023, we worked with polaris and the issara instituteâboth participants of the tat acceleratorâto scale their technology solutions to address human trafficking. amazon is increasing partnerships with key multi-stakeholder initiatives. in 2023, we expanded our relationships and work with key external partners that help us advance our work on modern slavery. we joined the mekong club, a non-profit that works with the private sector to address modern slavery. through the organization, we developed a suppli\u0002er-facing remediation guide and trained vendors in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates on responsible recruitment practices. we also continued our work with the indirect spend alliance (isa), an industry working group that aims to identify oper\u0002ational areas of shared human rights risk in pro\u0002curement and design a single industry approach to addressing hotspots. we collaborate with better workâs regional teams and participate in the buyers forum and business for social responsibilityâs (bsr) human rights working group to share knowledge and learnings about our human rights issues and discuss how to address them through collective action. efforts like these are vital to understanding hotspots across our supply chain and developing impactful risk mitigation strategies that put the interests of workers first. we are collaborating with the international organization for migration (iom). in 2023, amazon and iom partnered to collaborate on promoting the respect of human and labor rights of migrant workers in global supply chains. through this strategic collaboration, we will work together to advance our suppliersâ and business partnersâ respect of migrant workersâ rights and improve safe labor migration and socio-eco\u0002nomic inclusion. amazon and iom will focus on human rights due diligence, mapping labor migration processes across relevant corridors, capacity building

modern slavery statement 2023 introduction this statement is made pursuant to section 54 of the uk modern slavery act 2015 (the âactâ). it sets out the steps taken by renewi plc (the âcompanyâ) and our other group companies (the âgroupâ) during the financial year ending 31 march 2023 to prevent modern slavery or human trafficking in our own operations and supply chains. modern slavery is a term used to encapsulate offences in the act and takes various forms such as slavery, servitude, forced labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a personâs liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. businesses must be aware of the risks of modern slavery, not only ensuring there are appropriate working conditions within their own business, but also satisfying themselves that there is no modern slavery within its supply chain, plus taking appropriate action where necessary. renewi takes a zero tolerance stance on modern slavery. ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of our colleagues is a top priority and is at the core of our approach. the board seeks to continue to re\u0002enforce this throughout renewiâs operations and supply chains. should any member of staff, supplier or service provider act to the contrary, the board of renewi plc (the âboardâ) will not hesitate to take appropriate measures. through identifying potential and actual risks, then adopting measures to combat such, the board is confident, as far as possible, that there are and will continue to be sufficient measures and controls in place to discourage and deter modern slavery within our own business and those of our suppliers. renewiâs policies reflect our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all of our business relationships. however, we acknowledge that we must remain vigilant to the risks and ensure that our suppliers and service providers understand and play their part in ensuring that modern slavery and human trafficking does not occur in our own operations or supply chains. where necessary, we look to further strengthen controls throughout our business and our wider supply chain and seek to develop renewiâs policies in line with best practice and continuous improvement principles. for the purposes of this statement ârenewiâ refers to all group companies of renewi plc. appendix 1 lists the companies within the group. 1. our organisation renewi is a leading waste-to-product company, with deep expertise and an extensive breadth of waste management products and services. we focus on extracting value from waste and turning it into new materials rather than on its disposal through mass burn incineration or landfill. operating across three business divisions (commercial waste, mineralz & water and specialities), renewi handles almost 11 million tonnes of waste a year, of which 90% is either recycled or used for energy recovery and employs over 6,500 individuals in the uk and europe. (newline)  (newline) our six core values provide the foundations for everything we do at renewi and differentiates us from our competitors. we believe that how we act is just as important as what we do. our values underpin renewiâs commitment to run our business in a way that makes a positive contribution to our colleagues, customers and communities; including playing our part in eradicating modern slavery. furthermore, renewi subscribes to the 10 principles of the un global compact, an international initiative by the united nations to promote improved human rights, working conditions, environmental protection and anti-corruption. businesses, including renewi, that subscribe to these 10 principles commit to the following: human rights principle 1: support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. labour principle 3: uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; principle 4: promote the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; principle 5: promote the effective abolition of child labour; and principle 6: promote the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. environment principle 7: support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. anti-corruption principle 10: work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. as a part of global community, renewi recognizes its obligation to contribute to the un sustainable development goals. among them, goal 8, to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. goal 8 determines the actions to be taken including immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms. these core values and principles form the basis of renewiâs code of conduct, which applies to all employees, agency workers, interns and individuals working for the company on a contractual basis. the code of conduct outlines the conduct expected of individuals working for renewi but also what these individuals can expect from renewi. (newline)  (newline) 2. annual review and steps taken this statement is reviewed annually by the board of renewi plc and was approved for publication on our website and for submission to the modern slavery statement registry in september 2023. we published our first modern slavery statement in may 2017. since then, renewi has focused on strengthening the approach to the prevention of modern slavery within the renewi business and supply chains, particularly in the areas of greatest risk. summary of steps taken by renewi in 2022/23 â¢ in 2022/23 there was continuation of our approach to anti-slavery, paying particular attention to roll\u0002out into the benelux. the main area of focus remained that of the use of short-term temporary labour, a known area of higher risk for the waste sector. â¢ the actions to further mitigate the risks of modern slavery have included: o creating awareness among our benelux suppliers on our modern slavery statement and expectations in this area; o obtaining information from suppliers of temporary labour in order to assess the options to reducing suppliers of temporary labour to a shorter list of trusted suppliers; o implementing a project to reduce the number suppliers of temporary labour in benelux from over 100 to 11 key suppliers in the netherlands and 3 key suppliers in belgium; o continued use of standard contracts and terms and conditions (which have been updated in the previous years) promoting modern slavery compliance in our supply chain and enabling carrying out supplier audits. â¢ following on from the campaign held in 2021, renewi again supported anti-slavery day in the uk on october 18, to raise awareness among staff and the public. internal messages were circulated, and posters displayed. messages were also posted on our social media platforms, intended to both educate and signpost to help and support, while underlining renewiâs commitment to a modern slavery free environment. â¢ renewi plc submitted its 2022 modern slavery statement to the uk government modern slavery statement registry. planned steps to be taken by renewi in 2023/24 â¢ efforts will continue to further unify practices in the uk and benelux, with the ambition of eventually having one group-wide approach to modern slavery. â¢ the execution of the plan of actions regarding the risk related to the supply of short-term temporary labour (as set out above) will be continued, focussing on: o designing awareness campaigns tailored for benelux; o facilitating closer relationships between our key suppliers of temporary labour in benelux with dedicated renewi account managers, o investigation of the deployment on online tools and services to further develop transparency in our supply chains; o identification and review of any requirements emanating from the corporate sustainability reporting directive (csrd), developing any implementation plans as may be required â¢ there will be another anti-slavery awareness campaign held during anti-slavery week (16 â 22 october) and on anti-slavery day itself (18 october 2023). â¢ in 2023/24 the group intends to review its approach to modern slavery to ensure that our initiatives in this area remain robust and appropriate for the business. 3. our business and supply chains renewi regularly uses agency labour procured through third party providers and sources materials and waste for our business through external businesses. the majority of our suppliers are uk or eu companies based in western europe. (newline)  (newline) having undertaken a risk assessment, we have concluded that the greatest modern slavery risks lie within our supply chains and that we would benefit from a higher degree of oversight in relation to our indirect suppliers and contractors, where the modern slavery risk is deemed higher. renewi remains committed to identifying such potential risks and responds appropriately. our group procurement team works closely with our suppliers and service providers. where possible, we build long-standing relationships with these parties, making clear our expectation that suppliers and service providers take the same anti-slavery and human trafficking stance as renewi and take reasonable steps to ensure the same is adhered to within their own supply chains. all suppliers of labour, goods and services to renewi must comply with relevant legislation and international standards as relevant to their industry, including child and forced labour, health and safety of workers, non-discrimination, employment law, human rights, fraud, bribery and corruption. where required by law, suppliers and service providers must produce an annual modern slavery statement pursuant to section 54(1) of the modern slavery act 2015. renewi takes action to ensure that suppliers comply with renewiâs policies by screening significant suppliers on sustainability issues, including human rights and labour standards. we intend to explore online tools to improve our control and monitoring of our supply chain as renewi grows and evolves. further control mechanisms in the yearly supplier audits are in place, carried out by external auditor(s), as part of our iso certification. it has been contractually agreed with the key suppliers of temporary labour that they organize self-assessments to investigate potential issues, including risk of modern slavery, and to discuss the outcomes with renewi in management review meetings. during the year, we implemented a comprehensive hr system that will enable the integration of legacy personnel administration systems from across the group. external workforce management was key requirement in the tender process for the system. the system selected has the capability to facilitate improved management of data on our temporary/ flexible workforce. in 2018/19 group payment and employment practices for our permanent employees were harmonised as part of the post-merger rationalisation. however, we recognise the risks highlighted in light of operation fort, the largest modern slavery and human trafficking case to go through the british courts, where victims were found working as short-term temporary staff for some of the ukâs most well\u0002known waste companies. renewi operates a preferred supplier list for the provision of direct temporary labour, contract workers and the recruitment of new employees. we only work with recruitment agencies that share our stance against all forms of modern slavery. any health, safety and environmental breaches or incidents by or involving service providers or temporary staff is reported to the board and appropriate action taken. should any indicators of modern slavery be identified, we would work with our suppliers to investigate and where appropriate, report to the necessary authorities. should renewi consider a supplier or service provider has failed to comply with any of the above, we will undertake review of the supplier or service providers contract, resulting in appropriate action being taken for any breach, up to immediate termination of the contract. 4. our staff ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of our colleagues is crucial to renewiâs success and this responsibility is taken very seriously. our people are crucial to our continued success. their dedication and commitment to our âwaste no moreâ goal is one of the key reasons our customers choose to work with us. this is why the health, safety, wellbeing and engagement of our people is a top priority for renewi. this starts with making sure our colleagues go home safely every day. all colleagues must adhere to renewiâs code of conduct, and our company policies including bullying and harassment, disciplinary, equal opportunities and grievance. our code of conduct includes reference to laws such as the modern slavery act 2015, setting out our expectations, and detailing how (newline)  (newline) suspected instances of modern slavery should be reported to our integrity team through the 24/7 confidential whistle-blowing hotline. our policies are clearly defined and communicated. our colleagues are treated fairly and equally and are paid at least the national minimum wage and renewi complies with our obligations under the working time regulations. to raise awareness of modern slavery and trafficking and of our policies and procedures, an e-learning training model has been developed to train colleagues in the uk with responsibilities for people management and recruitment. in the future this will also include e-learning in the benelux, as our approach towards modern slavery is further rolled-out into the rest of the group. further to this, every october, as part of anti-slavery day, we hold an annual group-wide awareness campaign to help our staff understand how to recognise and report instances of modern slavery. we also raise awareness of renewiâs zero tolerance approach to modern slavery through our group magazine and other communication platforms. in 2019 renewi established a modern slavery working group to help drive a more unified approach to modern slavery. the working group comprises representatives from hr, legal and procurement departments from across the group and helps drive renewiâs approach to modern slavery, and where required, makes recommendations to the board over its modern slavery obligations. a primary focus for this group has been to promote awareness in the various countries in which we operate, recognising the varying levels of awareness around the risk of modern slavery within those countries. this will include training for our managers and communication campaigns to create awareness amongst employees. all sites are overseen by competent management teams to ensure optimum control of the work environment. 5. other the following companies

(newline)  (newline) 11 code of conduct doing business ethically code of conduct (newline)  (newline) 12 code of conduct bribery and corruption we have a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. bribery, a form of corruption, is harmful and illegal, and we must not engage in it in any way. bribery means giving, offering, receiving, or requesting a corrupt or improper payment or advantage in exchange for something in return. examples of situations in which pressure to pay a bribe might arise: n to win or keep a contract. n to obtain a certificate or permit. n to secure payment of an invoice. n to avoid a fine or penalty. n to clear goods through customs. n to gain an advantage over a competitor. a bribe could consist of something of value such as money, gifts, entertainment, services, employment, charitable donations, political contributions, preferable treatment, or some other advantage. small extra payments to individuals for the performance of routine government or official actions (also known as âfacilitationâ or âgreaseâ payments) are a type of bribery and therefore equally prohibited. there may be very rare exceptions, usually in an emergency, where such payments are required such as if a colleagueâs safety is threatened. seek advice before considering making such a payment. meals, hospitality, and small gifts can be legitimate activities when conducted appropriately. however, they could be a form of bribery if they are excessive in value, inappropriate in nature, too frequent, or intended to have an improper influence on a business decision. all such activities must be carried out in accordance with the gifts and hospitality policy and travel and expenses policy for the relevant business. if a third party who is acting for us, such as a supplier or agent, pays a bribe then we could be held liable as if we paid it ourselves. we do not want contracts with customers who seek bribes as that kind of business is unethical, illegal, and unsustainable. we must therefore avoid working with people or organisations which engage in corrupt practices. any association with bribery, wherever it happens in the world, would be likely to cause severe damage to our reputation and could have serious legal and financial repercussions. for our staff, bribery constitutes serious misconduct which would result in disciplinary actions, up to and including dismissal, and possible criminal proceedings. n stay up-to-date with training on this topic. n never give, offer, accept or request a bribe in any form, directly or indirectly. n be particularly careful when dealing with any kind of government or public official, and do not offer them anything of value without clear approval to do so. n only give or accept appropriate gifts and entertainment in line with the relevant gifts and hospitality policy, and ensure that they are recorded. n carry out appropriate checks on our suppliers, ensure they are aware of and agree to comply with our supplier code of conduct and anti-bribery & corruption policy, and enter into written contracts with them that contain anti-bribery obligations. n if unsure whether anything may constitute a bribe, err on the side of caution and seek advice. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the anti-bribery & corruption policy on www.rentokil-initial.com and group legal guidance on the ri intranet, as well as the gifts and hospitality section on page 26. speak you can speak to your manager, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: iâve been asked to pay a rebate to a customer to secure the renewal of a large contract. this is not referred to anywhere in the contract terms, but itâs a very valuable contract for a key customer. what should i do? a: do not pay it and seek advice. this sounds like an illegitimate payment request. (newline)  (newline) 13 code of conduct trade controls and sanctions we are committed to operating in compliance with all applicable trade controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations. trade controls and sanctions may prohibit some or all business activities within certain countries and/or with specific individuals or entities. violation of these controls can have serious consequences, including significant fines and/or imprisonment. to ensure we abide by applicable controls and sanctions requirements, we have a policy and guidance to assist our colleagues in understanding the specific requirements relating to their business and functional activities. examples of activities that could result in non-compliance findings: n providing goods or services to, or doing business with individuals, entities, or countries that are subject to sanctions, including merger & acquisition activities. n engaging in or facilitating transactions or business activities that involve individuals, entities, or countries that are subject to sanctions. n making payment to or receiving payments from individuals, entities, or countries that are subject to sanctions. n engaging in any activity that could contribute to the evasion of sanctions. n providing false or misleading information to relevant authorities in relation to sanctions compliance. we are committed to conducting our business in an ethical and legal manner, and complying with all applicable trade and sanctions laws and regulations is a key part of this commitment. by doing so, we honour our vision to be the most loved and respected services business on the planet â delivering in the right way. n understand and comply with applicable laws and policies related to trade controls and sanctions. n always record international transactions accurately and completely. n recognise that the laws of more than one country may apply to a particular transaction. n contact your local legal team if you have one or group legal if you ever have questions about a particular transaction. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the sanctions policy and accompanying guidance on the intranet, under group legal, legal compliance. speak you can speak to your manager, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: weâve found that a potential customer is on a sanctions list in another country, but they arenât sanctioned in the country providing the services. is it okay for us to pursue a business relationship and contract with them? a: probably not. several sanctions regimes restrict dealings related to certain persons and entities, so even if they are located in countries other than the sanctioned jurisdiction, the sanctions can still apply. if you donât find the answer you need from the policy and related guidance, contact group legal for help. (newline)  (newline) 14 code of conduct competition and antitrust we must compete fairly and lawfully wherever we operate. it is critical to our success that we compete for and win business from customers. however, rentokil initial expects all of its businesses to compete in the marketplace in a manner that is lawful, ethical, and allows for healthy competition. most countries have laws prohibiting anti-competitive behaviour and regulate dealings between competitors, customers, suppliers, and distributors. generally, this means we cannot engage in behaviour that might restrict competition and/or distort the market, such as price fixing, market sharing, sharing of confidential/sensitive information, and bid rigging with competitors. if your business is a market leader or has a high market share, it could be treated as having a dominant market position in which case even stricter provisions would likely apply to prevent your business from abusing its position, like aggressively seeking to drive competitors out of business. these laws vary around the world and some, such as in the us and eu, can apply even when the conduct occurs outside the relevant territory. penalties for breaching competition law can be severe and could expose rentokil initial, and even individuals, to: n significant civil and criminal sanctions, including huge fines and prison sentences. n investigations and legal proceedings. n reputational damage and loss of business. n stay up-to-date with training on this topic and familiarise themselves with applicable laws in their market. if in doubt, seek advice. n compete rigorously but fairly, on the basis of the quality and other merits of our services and products. n treat all customers fairly on price, terms, and services we offer them. n ensure any meetings held with competitors are for a lawful purpose, such as trade association meetings to discuss legitimate issues affecting the industry as a whole. n follow the trade association policy should they wish to attend trade association meetings. n leave any meetings or end conversations that raise any anti-competitive issues and immediately inform their manager or legal team/group legal. n if our business is dominant in its market, ensure it does nothing that could be construed as abusing its dominant position or unfairly trying to reduce competition. n ensure they do not share any commercially-sensitive information with competitors. n gather market intelligence through legitimate means. n seek advice before collaborating with a competitor (including as their customer or supplier) and ensure any information exchanged is strictly limited to what is required for that particular transaction. n take care in any communications, especially in writing, regarding market shares and any other sensitive information. inaccurate statements of our market share could be used against us if we were ever investigated. n never engage in any contact with competitors where prices, costs, margins, commercial contract terms, markets, or customers are discussed. n never agree with competitors, directly or indirectly, to fix prices or other contract terms or to divide up markets, territories, or customers. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the rentokil initial competition law policy and the rentokil initial trade association policy under core group policies on the ri intranet. speak you can speak to your manager, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: a competitor suggests that we coordinate responses to two tenders so we each stand a good chance of winning one. is this the âwin-winâ situation he suggests? a: no this would be illegal bid rigging. we must decide our responses to all tenders independently. (newline)  (newline) 15 code of conduct accurate reporting, accounts and records it is essential we record and report all information accurately and honestly. all colleagues must ensure accurate and honest recording and reporting of information in order to conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the companyâs system of internal controls. this applies to all information relevant to our business, including our annual report, monthly management accounts, sales figures, contracts, and personal expenses claims, as well as non-financial information such as health and safety reports and supplier audits. our financial and accounting records are relied upon by our management, directors, investors, and the public to make informed decisions about our business and may also be provided to regulatory and governmental authorities. we must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, accounting standards, and our own accounting policies, and ensure the financial information we produce provides a true and fair view of our business and is not in any way misleading. revenue and profit figures must be accurate and recognised in the correct period in line with the requirements of applicable accounting standards. any material areas of judgement or subjectivity must be agreed upon with group accounting. all sales and customer contracts must be appropriately documented and correctly recorded in the relevant contract-administration system. all business expenses must be accurately recorded and supported by documentation. if a colleague is not sure if an expense is legitimate, they should refer it to their manager. n ensure all our books, records, data, and accounts are accurate and complete. n never artificially inflate sales or profit figures, or falsely move them between reporting periods. n never make any false or misleading entry into any report, record, or expense claim. n be vigilant for any fraud or misreporting and immediately report any concerns. n never create or use any undisclosed, âoff the booksâ or âghostâ accounts, contracts or funds. n record and document all transactions appropriately. n follow all applicable rentokil initial accounting policies and procedures and comply with all relevant laws, regulations, and standards. n ensure all control procedures are rigorously applied and fully documented in line with our documented internal control framework. all colleagues are expected to: q&as for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the group accounting policies in the central finance section of the group intranet. speak you can speak to your finance team. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: iâve noticed that sales seems to invoice additional sales at the end of each quarter, some of which is re-credited at the beginning of the following quarter. what should i do? a: if you are concerned, you should raise the issue with your manager or finance team. q: my manager has asked me to pay for a dinner with customers which both of us attended and to claim it back through expenses. what should i do? a: the most senior colleague present should pay for meals or entertainment and should have it authorised by their line manager. it is not acceptable to ask junior colleagues to pay for expenses where the purpose of doing so is to circumvent obtaining appropriate approval. q: my sales manager says heâs agreed to a big sale with a customer which should be included in this yearâs figure, but the âpaperworkâ wonât be signed until january. can i include it? a: the contract needs to be finalised and signed before the revenue can be booked, so you should not include it unless that can all be in place by the end of the year. (newline)  (newline) 16 code of conduct respecting the world in which we work code of conduct (newline)  (newline) 17 code of conduct environment we seek to minimise our impact on the environment and all colleagues have a role to play in protecting the environment. emissions and pollution to air, ground, and water, as well as odour and noise, can create problems for the companyâs neighbours and the wider environment. sound waste management and careful use of material resources and energy are both environmentally and economically sensible. the company will strive to use material resources in an effective way. we will minimise the use of energy and emissions to air, ground, and water. we will also minimise the creation of waste and manage unavoidable waste in an environmentally considerate manner wherever possible. the company will comply with all environmental laws and regulations. it will also publicly report, at least annually, its achievement against key performance indicators, such as energy usage and co2 emissions. the company will strive when developing and using materials and products, to identify methods and materials that reduce our impact on the environment. we will also strive to reduce our consumption of scarce resources and will seek to use sustainable resources whenever and wherever possible. all colleagues must comply with applicable laws and regulations and respect the environment in all work-related activities, whether or not on the companyâs property. n conduct their work in a way that complies with environmental laws and regulations and minimises any significant adverse effect on the environment. n report the matter immediately on becoming aware of, or suspecting, a violation of environmental laws or the companyâs principles relating to environmental matters. n understand and comply with all relevant permits, regulations, policies, and guidance if their job involves supervising or handling regulated and/or hazardous materials. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the environment policy, the health and safety policy under core group policies on the ri intranet, and the companyâs responsible business report on www.rentokil-initial.com for further information. further guidance can also be found in the she section of the ri intranet. speak you can speak to your manager, local she team, local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: some chemicals have been accidentally spilt in the course of our work. what should i do? a: ensure that you and any colleagues/others nearby are safe and then immediately report the incident to your line manager and follow the procedures your business has in place to deal with the spillage. if the incident counts as a major incident (e.g. hazardous chemicals are discharged into a watercourse), the group major incident reporting procedure should be followed. in any case, the incident should be investigated, and steps taken to prevent reoccurrence. (newline)  (newline) 18 code of conduct community, charitable and political activity we respect our local communities. we understand we have a responsibility to play a positive role in our local communities. rentokil initial assists where possible the involvement of colleagues in the cultural, educational, and social development of the communities in which the company operates and its employees live. as an organisation, we make corporate donations and raise funds for various charitable causes. it is important that any charitable contributions on behalf of the company are properly authorised and should not be used to gain improper advantage. the company encourages personal charitable giving, particularly where its employees take an active role, and has a matched-giving scheme to support colleaguesâ efforts. as a non-political organisation, rentokil initial will refrain from making any contribution, whether in cash or kind, to any political candidate, party, or organisation whose activities are designed to promote the interests of political parties or political ideologies. the company and all of its colleagues are part of society wherever it operates and in all societies, matters relating to politics play an important role for both businesses and individuals. from time to time political subjects of legitimate interest and importance to the company may arise. only properly authorised personnel may engage in any communication that might be considered as participating in the political process (including political lobbying). see page 23. colleagues, in their personal capacity, are free to participate in any community, charitable, trade union, or political activity of their choice on an individual basis, with their own money and in their own time, but this must not interfere with their work for the company, create a conflict of interest, or bring the company into disrepute. colleagues should be careful to ensure any such activity could not be interpreted as being on behalf of, or connected with, our business (unless it is previously authorised). n respect the communities in which we operate and be sensitive to culture and customs. n obtain any necessary approvals, in accordance with the group authority schedule, prior to agreeing to make any charitable donations on behalf of rentokil initial. n never make any charitable contributions that are, or could be construed as, for the purposes of seeking a business or personal advantage or influence. n never make any political donations or engage in any political process on behalf of rentokil initial without prior approval, in accordance with the group authority schedule. n keep personal, political, and charitable activities separate from work activities. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the community involvement policy on www.rentokil-initial.com and see the rentokil initial cares section on the ri intranet. speak you can speak to your manager or the corporate communications team. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: a customer has requested that we provide financial support to a local charity and has suggested that if we donât we may lose business. what should i do? a: you should raise the matter with your managing director. it is not acceptable for such support to be provided to avoid losing business as this would be a bribe. (newline)  (newline) 19 code of conduct protecting our organisation code of conduct (newline)  (newline) 20 code of conduct contracts the business contracts we enter into must be authorised and observed properly. contracts define our business relationships with customers, suppliers, and other third parties with whom we do business. they are an important means of managing risks by setting out each partyâs obligations, providing clarity as to how the relationship should work and limiting our exposure if things go wrong. it is also critical we fully observe all of our duties and obligations contained in those contracts to preserve the companyâs commercial success and maintain its reputation. for customer contracts, we have a customer contracts minimum standards policy that sets out details of the minimum standard requirements in our contracts, as well as commentary on our standard contracting clauses. it is designed to help guide contract negotiators on internal policy regarding what can and cannot be amended by negotiation, and explanations of the purpose and importance of clauses. it should be read with the group authority schedule on financial and other key risk clauses (e.g., unlimited liability) and the escalation process to get approvals for exceptions to the standard arrangements. there is a separate group procurement policy which must be followed for all dealings with suppliers of products or services, along with the supplier code, which aligns the standards expected of our suppliers with those set out in this code. n follow the customer contracts minimum standards policy when negotiating and entering customer contracts. n observe the rentokil initial procurement policy and supplier code for supplier contracts. n follow the group authority schedule. n ensure all agreed terms are properly documented in writing. n not agree to carry out any unauthorised business activity or provide services in a territory outside our footprint without the appropriate group approval. n ensure that contracts and their terms are reviewed and approved at the appropriate level, in accordance with the group authority schedule. n familiarise themselves with, and observe, the terms of any contracts applicable to our activities. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the customer contracts minimum standards policy, group procurement policy, supplier code, and the group authority schedule on the ri intranet. speak you can speak to your manager, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: a key customer asked me if we can sort out some repairs to their roof, which i noticed needed doing. this is not what we normally do but we can find someone who could, which would keep the customer happy and avoid them going to a competitor. is this ok? a: we must not carry out unauthorised activities without specific authorisation from group. there are several reasons for this, including she risks, whether we would be insured, whether we have the appropriate license, and the damage it could cause to the customer and our reputation if something went wrong.

(newline)  (newline) 22 code of conduct fraud and money laundering we all have a role to play in preventing fraud and money laundering. rentokil initial is committed to preventing fraud and to maintaining an appropriate anti\u0002fraud culture, which is why the company has a zero-tolerance approach to fraud. fraud can potentially seriously damage the companyâs reputation, as well as expose individuals and the company to legal proceedings. no colleague should knowingly permit the carrying out of any fraudulent act by a business or another colleague in connection with the running of a rentokil initial business. any conduct that could potentially be fraudulent will result in an investigation that could lead to disciplinary action being taken against the offending party, which may result in dismissal. any concerns should be reported promptly to your manager or by using any of the ways set out in the advice and reporting concerns section on page 29. examples and potential indicators of fraud: n setting up false records of sales or contracts. n excessive use of write offs or credit notes. n âmoonlightingâ or secretly conducting rentokil initial services for personal payment. n request for changes to supplier or colleague bank account information. n forgeries or unauthorised alteration of documents. n payment or receipt of unusually high or low prices. n payments made for unclear reasons. n fictitious expenses. any incidents or suspicions of fraud committed against rentokil initial by external parties should be reported to your finance or legal team. do not request or authorise any payments where you suspect fraud could be involved. all colleagues must guard against money laundering: money laundering is the process whereby criminals attempt to hide or disguise the true origin and ownership of the proceeds of their criminal activities, thereby avoiding prosecution, conviction, and confiscation of the criminal funds. âtipping offâ anyone who may be attempting to commit a crime under the money laundering rules can also be a criminal offence. money laundering crimes can result in a colleague personally being subject to criminal sanctions and company disciplinary measures. circumstances that may indicate money laundering include a customer or other party being unwilling to provide personal information, wishing to pay large amounts in cash, being unconcerned about the amount they need to pay, using multiple accounts or payment methods, or using an account based in an unexpected location. n immediately report any potential fraud or other dishonest activity they become aware of or have suspicions about. n be cooperative, open and honest in any fraud investigation. n be alert to the possibility of fraud being committed within rentokil initial or by external parties and act on any suspicions. if something does not seem right then seek advice. n follow all best practice and advice issued in relation to preventing fraud attempts such as phishing emails. n be alert to circumstances or behaviour which could suggest money laundering and discuss any concerns with their finance team or group treasury. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the bribery and corruption section on page 12 and accurate reporting, accounts and records on page 15. speak you can speak to your manager, finance team, internal audit, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: i suspect a colleague might be involved in fraudulent behaviour. i want to report it, but i also want to avoid any personal repercussions. what should i do? a: there are a number of ways you can report this. you could speak to your manager or another senior colleague, contact your local legal team (if any) or group legal, inform the internal audit team or raise the issue by email or telephone through our anonymous reporting service speak up â see page 29 for further details. we will not tolerate any retaliation against people who, in good faith, report suspected ethical or legal misconduct or policy violations. (newline)  (newline) 23 code of conduct external communications only authorised personnel should speak or write on behalf of rentokil initial. as a large organisation, rentokil initial often attracts the attention of the media and other interested third parties. however, as a publicly listed company we must ensure that price sensitive information is released to the stock market before being released to any other party. it is also important to protect our reputation by being consistent and accurate and not misleading in our communications to the public and other stakeholders. the company therefore takes disclosure and communication of information very seriously. only those employees specifically authorised to do so may contact or respond to enquiries from the media, the public, or governmental bodies, or may release an announcement or statement on behalf of the company to the press or any stock exchange. any information relating to financial performance, acquisitions or divestments, joint ventures, investments, or major new contracts or contract losses that has not already been communicated publicly, must first be approved by the corporate communications department before public disclosure. statements about rentokil initialâs financial performance may only be made by properly authorised officers of the company. equally, only those colleagues specifically authorised to do so may contact or respond to enquiries from the investment community (shareholders, brokers, investment analysts, etc). colleagues must obtain authorisation before speaking at an event, giving an interview, or writing material for publication in their capacity as a rentokil initial employee. this authorisation may be provided by a member of the countryâs leadership team. this excludes business as usual marketing, social media, and pr activities which have their own dedicated approval channels. with anything corporate in nature, please contact group communications for authorisation and support. social media social media activities include, but are not limited to, using or participating in social or professional networking sites, such as facebook and linkedin, posting or reviewing content on photo or video-sharing sites, such as youtube, reddit, tiktok or instagram, creating âwikisâ and authoring or commenting on blogs, such as x (formerly known as twitter). when using social media, it is important colleagues are careful with communications that may impact the company or our colleagues, whether speaking on behalf of the company or in private communications, i.e., being mindful of anti-harassment and bullying policies, confidentiality of company, colleague, and customer information, etc. colleagues should not carry out any political lobbying on behalf of the company without authorisation from the ceo. n refer any inquiries from the media, investment community, regulatory body, government, customer, or the public to an authorised employee to manage, unless authorised to speak to them. n adhere to company policies, as well as other work rules, procedures, and protocols that govern the colleagueâs behaviour with respect to electronic communications, use of company property, and confidentiality obligations. n obey the law. respect intellectual property rights, privacy, libel, defamation, employment discrimination, financial disclosure, and other laws. n obtain proper authorisation, as outlined above, before speaking at an event or issuing any publication on behalf of rentokil initial. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the corporate communications section on the ri intranet, as well as any related policy your region may observe regarding the use of social media or professional networking, and the disclosure policy under core group policies on the ri intranet. speak you can speak to your manager, corporate communications team, or the company secretary. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: a friend asks if he should buy rentokil initial shares, what can i say? a: you can tell him/her what a great company you work for but should not mention any non-public information you have about our plans or future prospects. you could refer them to our website where there is plenty of information for potential investors. you should also consider our share dealing and inside information policy and seek advice from the company secretary if you are unsure.

(newline)  (newline) 26 code of conduct gifts and hospitality gifts and hospitality received and given must be reasonable, legitimate, and authorised. the offering or accepting of reasonable gifts and hospitality can have a positive and legitimate role to play in building relationships with business partners. it is generally acceptable if it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so, and is proportionate and not lavish or extravagant. however, gifts and hospitality must not be used to gain any improper advantage or in a way that might create a conflict of interest, lead to a sense of obligation, or affect judgement on the part of the recipient. gifts and hospitality must not influence any business decisions, or cause others to perceive such an influence. each rentokil initial business must maintain and implement a gifts and hospitality policy that puts in place sufficient guidance and limits on the giving or acceptance of all gifts and hospitality. these limits should be set to ensure gifts and hospitality are in keeping with local practices and laws, including anti-bribery laws. n comply with the applicable gifts and hospitality policy or travel and expenses policy, including with respect to the value, frequency, and recording of gifts and hospitality. n seek advice from their line manager before gifts or hospitality are offered or accepted if there is any case of doubt. n observe any applicable policies of customers, suppliers, and other third parties in this area. and not to: n give, promise to give, or offer a gift or hospitality with the expectation, intention, or hope that a business advantage will be received, such as the award of a new contract, or the retention of an existing one, or to reward a business advantage already given. n accept a gift or hospitality from a third-party if it is known or suspected that it is offered or provided with an expectation it will obtain a business advantage or could result in the colleague not acting objectively or effectively. n ask rentokil initial partners (including suppliers, business partners, joint venture partners, subcontractors, or advisors) to contribute towards the cost of entertaining customers on behalf of rentokil initial. n receive cash, or a cash equivalent (such as gift certificates, lottery tickets, or vouchers). n attempt to conceal or disguise gifts or hospitality given or received. n give to or accept gifts or hospitality from government officials or representatives, or politicians or political parties, without the prior approval of their line manager. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the gifts and hospitality and travel and expenses policies for your business. speak you can speak to your manager, your local legal team if you have one, or group legal. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: iâve been invited to a major football match with a contact, can i go? a: you need to consider whether your relationship with this person means they could expect a favour from rentokil initial in return, and what the value of the ticket and hospitality is. if you decide to go, you should record the entertainment in your local gifts and hospitality register. (newline)  (newline) 27 code of conduct insider trading we must not use inside information or material non-public information for personal financial benefit. colleagues must not use non-public, price-sensitive information for personal financial benefit, or to âtip offâ others who might make an investment decision on the basis of that information. this is both unethical and illegal, and could result in criminal proceedings, fines, imprisonment, and losing your job. from time to time, some colleagues will become âinsidersâ because they become aware of confidential information that could affect the price of the companyâs shares (perhaps because they are involved in a special project or are involved in preparing financial information for release to the market). special rules apply to people in this position, which will be explained to the respective people at the appropriate time. rentokil initial colleagues who have, or become aware of, information that might be price sensitive to the companyâs traded shares must ensure such information is kept confidential and not disclosed to any other colleague, or to third parties, other than on a strict need\u0002to-know basis pre-approved by the disclosure committee. potentially price-sensitive information received inadvertently or unexpectedly should be brought to the attention of the disclosure committee by contacting the company secretary. n never buy or sell shares in rentokil initial (or otherwise deal in the companyâs securities) while in possession of inside information or material non-public information about the group, or while they have been notified they are restricted from trading during a closed period. n avoid passing on inside information to others, such as relatives or friends. n comply with the group-wide share dealing policy. all colleagues are expected to: q&a for further information and advice and to report concerns read please refer to the share dealing and inside information section of the ri intranet, located on the group legal page. speak you can speak to your manager or the company secretary. report you can report any concerns using our confidential speak up reporting system or any other method described on page 29. q: i overheard a colleague talking about an imminent acquisition. does this mean i cannot trade in the companyâs shares? a: yes. you may be in possession of confidential information, which may be deemed to be inside information or material non-public information and you should not trade without seeking approval from the company secretary. the individual who was overheard should have been more careful and should not have been talking of confidential matters within earshot of other colleagues. (newline)  (newline) 28 code of conduct general guidance code of conduct (newline)  (newline) 29 code of conduct resolving ethical dilemmas ethical behaviour and decision making extends beyond legal requirements and as such requires colleagues to exercise judgement and accept personal responsibility. colleagues are encouraged to seek help or engage others in dialogue and debate to identify the

industry associations, non-governmental organizations, suppliers, and other companies, to strengthen our efforts to identify, prevent, and address the risk of all forms of modern slavery in our operations and business relationships. we helped increase our suppliersâ awareness and understanding of our supply chain standards through trainings, workshops, and resources, updated our modern slavery training available to amazon employees, and introduced a new way for members of the public to notify us about human rights concerns. we enhanced our partnerships with industry associations and non-profit organizations to further develop best practices in addressing risks of modern slavery. we are committed to continuously improving our approach to, and policies surrounding, prevention of

and our selling partners,6 making clear we do not tolerate modern slavery. we regularly review our strategies, principles, and supporting policies to identify opportunities for improvement. by engaging external stakeholders and monitoring evolving international and human rights standards, regulations, and industry best practices, we are able to effectively and continuously improve our own policies and standards to better support our employees and our suppliers.7 global human rights principles our global human rights principles demonstrate our commitment to respecting fundamental human rights and the dignity of people connected to our business around the world. we are committed to ensuring that the products and services we provide are produced in a way that respects human rights, including the right to freely chosen employment. our global human rights principles also state that we do not tolerate the use of child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking in any formâincluding slave labor, prison labor, indentured servitude, or bonded laborâin our operations or value chain. these principles are informed by leading international standards and frameworks developed by the united nations (un) and the international labour organiza\u0002tion (ilo). amazon is committed to respecting and supporting the un guiding principles on business and human rights (ungps), the un universal dec\u0002laration of human rights, the core conventions of the ilo, and the ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work. 6 selling partners are vendors and third-party sellers that sell or supply products and services in amazonâs stores. 7 we update our global human rights principles at least every five years and our supply chain standards at least every three years. our latest update to the supply chain standards was published in 2022. code of business conduct and ethics our code of business conduct and ethics (code of conduct), associated policies, procedures, training, and communications outline our expectations of our employees. all employees receive code of conduct training during onboarding, with regular refresher training thereafter. amazon provides its employees various secure and accessible channels with guidelines for reporting concerns and violations. employees can reach out to anyone in their management chain or the legal department with questions about the application of the code of conduct or how to approach difficult workplace situations. employees may also make reports online or via phone through the amazon ethics line, which is managed by an independent third party, and remain anonymous on request. the ethics line is currently available in more than 60 countries in 165 languages. any employee can also email suggestions or complaints to senior leadership. all escalations are reviewed by human resources and may inform process updates to prevent future gaps. we prohibit retaliation and take all allegations seriously. our business conduct and ethics team records, investigates (or directs others to investigate), reports alleged violations of the code of conduct to the audit committee of the board, and tracks any remediation required. employees must cooperate in internal investigations of potential or alleged misconduct, with those who violate the code of conduct subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge. supply chain standards publicly available in 21 languages and dialects and derived from relevant international standards and frameworks, our supply chain standards (also referred to as âour standardsâ) are the backbone to our efforts to enable a responsible supply chain. our supply chain standards apply to suppliers of goods and services for amazon and amazonâs subsidiaries, including providers, vendors, selling partners, contractors, and subcontractors (collec\u0002tively âsuppliersâ). all products sold in amazon stores, and all products and services provided to amazon, must be produced or provided in accordance with our supply chain standards. suppliers are required to conform to our standards and must follow all applicable laws and regulations. when applicable law conflicts with our standards, suppliers must follow the law while finding ways to respect the principles of internationally recognized human rights and the expectations contained in the standards. we encourage suppliers to perform human rights and (newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 6 environmental due diligence to ensure their products and services are produced and supplied in ways that respect human rights and the environment and protect the fundamental dignity of workers. our supply chain standards mandate that all workers must be treated with respect and dignity. suppliers must not engage in or tolerate violence, harassment, abuse, or coercion, including physical, verbal, sexual, or psychological, or any form of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. our supply chain standards require that all work must be voluntary and workers must be free to leave work and terminate their employment or other work status with reasonable notice, without penalty. suppliers must not cause workers to lose possession of or access to their personal documents. before they enter into employment or prior to departing their country of origin, workers must be given clear, under\u0002standable documentation that defines the terms and conditions of their employment in a language and manner they understand, with preference for each workerâs native or best understood language and/or visual images for workers with lower literacy levels. amazonâs supply chain standards recognize domestic and foreign migrant workersâ unique vul\u0002nerability to risks of exploitation and make clear that workers may not be charged fees at any point in the recruitment process. we expect our suppliers to analyze and monitor the practices of recruitment agencies and labor brokers and to employ agencies that act ethically and in the best interests of workers. in cases where remediation measures are taken, we will consider whether additional steps are necessary to address the income loss experienced by the most vulnerable families impacted by these measures. in addition, our standards require suppliers to engage workers who are: (i) at least 15 years old, (ii) the age of completion of compulsory education, or (iii) the minimum age to work in the country where work is performed, whichever is greater. workers under the age of 18 (âyoung workersâ) must not perform hazardous work, including that which is likely to jeopardize their health or safety, or work that compromises their education (e.g., night shifts, overtime). if cases of child labor are identified our standards mandate remediation, including through corrective measures that facilitate the childâs safety and wellbeing. assessing our risk understanding our modern slavery risk is critical to our actions and partnerships to prevent and address the issue. amazonâs centralized team of experts work across the company to conduct human rights and environmental due diligence. through this work, amazon takes steps to assess and prioritize risks, takes action to address and mitigate identified risks, measures progress, and remediates harm when issues occur. in line with the ungps, identifying and prioritizing the most salient risks, including with respect to modern slavery, connected to amazon operations and business relationships is central to our human rights due diligence practices. as we continuously improve and expand these practices, we use human rights assessment methodologies to identify and mitigate human rights risks. these assessments help us understand the causes of systemic issues, enhance ongoing engagement with critical stake\u0002holders, implement the right risk-based mitigation measures, and refine strategies for ongoing risk management across our supply chain. examples of human rights assessment methodologies include: â¢ human rights saliency assessments, which focus risk management action and remediation on the most severe risks relevant to a companyâs business activity. â¢ human rights impact assessments (hrias), which examine a particular business segment or product, a country of operation or sourcing, a potentially affected group, or other human rights risk areas for a specific subset of a busi\u0002ness. â¢ human rights due diligence management as\u0002sessments, which analyze a businessâs internal capacity to assess and respond to human rights risks. these assessments allow us to identify salient risks, build capacity and business-level ownership aligned to those risks, and conduct targeted human rights and environmental due diligence to monitor and manage compliance. for more information about our 2020 enter\u0002prise-wide human rights saliency assessment, our human rights risks, and our human rights assess\u0002ments, please see our 2023 sustainability report. 8 our modern slavery risk assessment practices are informed by: vulnerable groups modern slavery experts and leading non-govern\u0002mental organizations play a key role in helping us identify modern slavery risks associated with our supply chain and operations. while modern slavery can impact any population, we recognize certain groups are particularly vulnerable, including: 8 the concept of salience uses the lens of risk to people, not the business, as the starting point, while recognizing that where risks to peopleâs human rights are greatest, there is often strong convergence with risk to the busi\u0002ness. united nations guiding principles reporting framework. (newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 7 â¢ domestic and foreign migrant workers â¢ contract, agency, and temporary workers â¢ refugees, asylum seekers, ethnic/religious mi\u0002norities, and displaced persons â¢ young or student workers â¢ indigenous peoples region-specific risk even though modern slavery can be found in all countries, we take into account region-spe\u0002cific risks. based on globally accepted risk indices such as the world bankâs worldwide governance indicators, the global slavery index, and those issued by the us department of labor, ilo, and unicef, we understand that certain countries may present higher risks for modern slavery; for example, countries with large populations of migrant workers, with weaker labor law enforcement, where charging workers recruitment fees is common practice, or where modern slavery prevalence has been well documented. we use a risk-based approach tailored to the regional context to identify country-specific risks and implement site-level requirements to help build local suppliersâ capacity to meet our standards. in countries identified as higher-risk, we mandate participation in better work - a joint program of the ilo and the international finance corporation (a member of the world bank group) - that works directly with factories, workers, and their represen\u0002tatives to support greater compliance with national labor laws and international labor standards through assessments, training, advocacy, and research. where better work is unavailable, we require par\u0002ticipation in an amazon-managed audit. alongside these targeted interventions, we participate in and offer our suppliers a wide array of central and local capacity-building programs. these enable suppliers to develop their in-house capabilities and improve social compliance performance. we continually review our supply chain footprint to evaluate where additional due diligence, partnership, and collabora\u0002tion are needed. our supply chain we understand that our supply chains, including for our amazon-branded products,9 present a need for focused efforts to assess the risk of modern slavery. we prioritize the protection of human rights within our supply chain and regularly engage suppliers on key human rights issues. we routinely evaluate our supply chains to understand the highest risks to workers and prioritize our efforts to address both 9 amazon-branded products are apparel, consumer electronics, food and beverage, and home good products such as amazon basics, amazon devices (e.g., kindle, fire tv, echo) or other private labels owned by amazon. this includes any product manufactured or co-manufactured by amazon, including its subsidiaries. site-specific challenges and broader, systemic risks. we require suppliers to continuously monitor and enforce our supply chain standards in their own operations and supply chain, including with sub\u0002contractors. suppliers are encouraged to self-eval\u0002uate and make improvements to meet or exceed our expectations and those of our customers as reflected in our standards. we encourage suppliers to continuously assess their risks specific to groups that may be more vulnerable to exploitation, including women, children, indigenous peoples, and temporary or migrant workers. for both our operationsâ non-inventory products and services and our amazon-branded products, we engage with internal and external stakehold\u0002ers, evaluate country- and industry-level risks, and conduct regular risk assessments that include worker and management interviews, document reviews, and on-site visits and audits. for our amazon-branded products, we also regularly consult industry experts to review our approach to risk assessment against globally recognized international standards and industry best practices. audits are conducted for suppliers who manufacture products that are amazon-branded and who provide services (e.g., staffing agencies, janitorial companies) or not-for-resale goods in our operations. we assess these suppliers globally during onboarding and peri\u0002odically thereafter to evaluate their compliance with our supply chain standards. auditors conduct regular site inspections, confidential worker interviews or surveys, and review and analyze site documents or licenses. when an audit finding requires a more hands-on approach, we also send amazon teams or third-party experts to conduct further assess\u0002ments. we assess suppliers against modern slavery indicators, for example where an employer does not communicate the full terms of employment, does not give clear documentation defining those terms in a language the worker understands, does not give required notice of overtime, collects recruitment and related fees that can lead to debt bondage, or takes a workerâs identification document. to date, we have focused our efforts on our products supply chains. however, over the past two years, we increased our investments in identifying and addressing the highest risks across the supply chains related to our own operations. at the supplier site level, we look for modern slavery indicators that can suggest heightened risk, including the presence of workers who are part of vulnerable populations, a supplierâs failure to deliver on a promised term of employment, restriction of worker movement, a supplierâs retention of identity documents, and debt bondage indicators, such as charging recruitment fees or mandatory overtime. this data informs our (newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 8 efforts to respond to those risks. as described in further detail below, we are developing regional and country-level strategies tailored to specific social, cultural, economic, and regulatory contexts and have ongoing due diligence in place to address these risks. addressing our risk we aim consistently to deliver progress and expand our work to understand and address any modern slavery risks that may arise in the course of our business. â¦with our suppliers of amazon-branded prod\u0002ucts we support our suppliers to meet our standards. amazon continuously works to make its suppliers aware of our supply chain standards and supports their efforts to build the skills and mechanisms to meet them. we have dedicated teams in key sourcing regions that engage directly with suppliers to com\u0002municate our supply chain standards. we also con\u0002tinuously monitor regulations in the countries where we operate and actively engage with our teams and suppliers to meet new regulatory requirements. throughout our relationship with our suppliers, we provide resources and training to help them strengthen their ability to respect human rights within their own workplace and supply chain. in 2023, we hosted in-person and online training events on our supply chain standards. we also launched a new in-person peer-learning workshop series that convenes factory management to hear from industry experts and share best practices for addressing common challenges in bangladesh, cambodia, china, malaysia, saudi arabia, singapore, taiwan, thailand, and the united arab emirates. we are building efforts to amplify the voice of workers in our supply chain. we want all workers in our supply chain to have the ability to voice their concerns in a safe and confidential manner. to do this, we connect suppliers and service providers with trusted tools, products, and systems to hear directly from workers about their experience and support the resolution of issues from workersâ perspectives. with these mechanisms, suppliers can gather feedback directly from workers to inform more effective issue resolution. in 2023, we helped connect supplier sites across bangladesh, cambodia, china, india, malaysia, pakistan, and thailand with independent grievance mechanisms. in 2023, we expanded the scope of our program to additional supplier segments across our operations supply chain. in japan, we partnered with the japan platform for migrant workers towards responsi\u0002ble and inclusive society (jp-mirai) so that certain suppliers in japan could provide their workers access to jp-miraiâs independent grievance mechanism. we continue to improve our responsible sourcing program for amazon-branded products. our responsible sourcing program works to reduce risks and help safeguard the rights of workers, especially those considered part of a vulnerable population or who work in countries associated with a higher modern slavery risk. supply chain transparency is a valuable tool to address risks in our supply chain and identify oppor\u0002tunities for collaboration on systemic supply chain issues. we publish a supplier list and interactive supply chain map with details on over 2,220 fin\u0002ished-product suppliers of amazon-branded apparel, consumer electronics, food and beverage, and home goods products. we also contribute this supplier list to the open supply hub to foster brand col\u0002laboration and action in the industry. open supply hub is an accessible, collaborative supply chain mapping platform, used and populated by stake\u0002holders across sectors and supply chains. in 2023, we leveraged the platformâs embedded map, which lists facilities producing amazon-branded products. the embedded map allows users to easily interact with facility data and have a transparent look into amazonâs supply chain. we provide data from supplier audits annually in our sustainability reporting, including year-over\u0002year data on high- and medium-level issues in our supply chain and actions to address our human rights risks. we engage in due diligence of suppliers of amazon-branded products. our supplier manual provides an overview of our due diligence processes. table 1: 2021, 2022, and 2023 related audit findings we accept audits completed by qualified indepen\u0002dent audit firms based on our own audit standards and those of industry associations, including sedex (smeta), amfori

workers should be at the center of any remediation effort. we put the safety and interests of affected workers first. 10 audits are conducted for suppliers who manufacture products that are amazon-branded and who provide services (e.g., staffing agencies, janitorial compa\u0002nies) or not-for-resale goods in our operations. as explained further below, while we are conscious that audits are not the answer to all potential modern slavery risks, audits are one of the tools that help us determine where to focus our efforts and resources. we rely on our audit processes to provide us with important information about our responsible sourcing program so we can respond to the needs of workers making products that are amazon-branded. these insights help us tailor our programs and identify strategic partnerships, build supplier capacity, and address and prevent these issues. audits also help us detect an issue before we engage with suppliers or during our relationship with them so that we can work with suppliers to remedy the issue. when we identify a gap between a supplierâs practices and our supply chain standards, we track remediation and conduct follow-up assessments as needed. between assessments, our central team directly engages with suppliers to discuss open issues and remediation progress, and provides them with issue-specific remediation guidebooks. assessment findings are flagged as high, medium, or low depending on severity. when high- and medium- level issues are identified, we take steps to verify that suppliers have made meaningful progress toward remediation. failure to implement the actions listed in the corrective action plan may prevent the supplier from continuing production or providing services or labor to amazon. for low-level issues, we monitor suppliers for continuous improve\u0002ment through maintenance audits. for remediation plans, we expect suppliers to act within an agreed\u0002upon timeline, remove harm, act in the best interests of workers, and commit to preventing similar issues in the future. we operate with an approach based on continuous improvement, meaning we work with suppliers to embed respect for human rights in their operations and supply chain, to improve their practices to protect workers, and improve working conditions. when issues are identified, remediation can also be a challenge. for example, working with our suppliers to remediate worker-paid recruitment fees is particularly challenging in countries where payment of recruitment fees is a part of accepted business practice or an accepted part of government programs. if we terminate business with a supplier, we remove the incentive for the supplier to improve, which can have a detrimental effect on workers and the community. however, because improve\u0002ment is not always possible, we reserve the right to (newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 10 terminate a relationship at any time for failure to meet our supply chain standards. we track the results of our audits and remedia\u0002tion measures to assess their effectiveness, and continue to update our due diligence mechanisms to drive lasting change focused on benefiting workers in our supply chain. we are actively pursuing new mechanisms, technology solutions, and pilot programs to enhance our ability to pro\u0002actively identify and mitigate risks, and positively impact the well-being of workers. we also know we cannot address many of these complex issues alone; systemic issues contributing to modern slavery risks will require broader collaboration between govern\u0002ments, international organizations, the private sector, and civil society. we develop materials and sponsor workshops to empower suppliers to strengthen their own management systems and contribute to industry association and multi-stakeholder initia\u0002tives working to address systemic issues. we continue to deepen our due diligence beyond our direct suppliers. commodity supply chains are com\u0002plicated and fragmented, and improved visibility into raw material supply chains better enables businesses to identify human rights and labor rights violations and hold suppliers accountable. responding to violations of our supply chain standards in saudi arabia in 2023, amazon found violations of our supply chain standards at a third-party licensed temporary labor agency (âthird-party vendorâ) in saudi arabia through an independent audit. the violations ranged from recruitment fees paid by migrant workers to the absence of grievance mechanisms and issues with worker accommo\u0002dations. external organizations raised similar concerns and shared information with us about these and other human rights risks collected during interviews with former employees of this third-party vendor. in response, we conducted a deeper dive into practices of our third-party vendors throughout saudi arabia and developed a series of short- and long-term measures to remedy immediate issues and prevent future recurrence. we involved two independent third parties to assist with our inves\u0002tigation and engaged directly with contracted workers through interviews and other means to help establish reimbursement amounts and manage repayment. as of february 2024, we have reimbursed more than 700 workers across all our third-party licensed temporary labor agencies in saudi arabia, totaling more than $1.9 million usd in reimbursed recruitment fees and related costs. through audits, we also verified that the third-party vendor remediated the most serious concerns about worker housing. we also secured the vendorâs commitment that after its employees cease working at amazon, it will pay its employees in line with their contracts and will not move them to a new accommodation site that fails to meet amazonâs standards. this vendor also established a more robust system to enable workers to anonymously raise grievances. we also adopted enhanced controls to reduce the risk of recurrence. among other measures related to third-party licensed temporary labor agencies in saudi arabia, we strengthened contracts to clarify expectations regarding compliance with our supply chain standards; reviewed wage policies, including clarification that illegal wage deductions are prohibited; provided additional training to vendors in the region on how to implement our supply chain standards, including responsible recruitment practices; and improved our communication mechanism that enables contracted workers to share concerns directly with amazonâs management. learn more about our response here. responsible mineral sourcing according to our supply chain standards, amazon suppliers should source commodities used in products in a way that respects local communities and protects ecosystems. suppliers should consis\u0002tently monitor the social and environmental per\u0002formance of their upstream suppliers in line with recognized due diligence frameworks. we recognize certain mineral supply chains are at higher risk of modern slavery. we conduct due diligence on high-risk minerals, including tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold, and cobalt, through our responsible minerals program. while amazon does not engage in direct sourcing from mine sites and smelters, we are committed to avoiding the use of minerals that have fueled conflict. we encourage our suppliers to support our effort to identify the origin of designated minerals used in our products consistent with recognized due diligence frameworks and source from smelters and refiners that have successfully completed a recognized third-party responsible minerals audit. our process for mapping and addressing our risks related to mineral sourcing can be found in our most recent conflict minerals report filed with the united states securities and exchange commission. we engage suppliers on the importance of responsible mineral sourcing mechanisms and industry collaboration. we are members of the (newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 11 to help promote better standards for cotton more widely, amazon sponsors and participates in the responsible sourcing network initiative yessâ¢: yarn ethically & sustainably sourced. yess supports fabric and spinning mills in implementing a risk-based due diligence approach for cotton sourcing, and promotes collaboration with the goal of preventing, mitigating, and remediating forced labor in cotton production. in 2023, yess launched its program to assess fabric and spinning mills in india and pakistan. amazon is supporting yessâs efforts to scale and to expand the program to vietnam and bangladesh. we continue to expand our responsible recruitment interventions. amazon is committed to addressing deceptive recruitment practices and payment of recruitment fees, which can be indicators of modern slavery. our responsible recruitment interventions aim at gaining greater visibility into supplier and employment agency recruitment practices, and at reducing the risk of forced labor in amazonâs supply chain. through increased due diligence and new strategic partnerships, we have deepened our understand\u0002ing of recruitment practices in different regions and industries. this work highlighted root causes of risks, particularly in origin and destination countries for foreign migrant workers. charging workers recruitment fees is not permitted under amazonâs supply chain standards. where fees were found to have been charged, we support our suppliers to understand ethical recruitment practices, create and implement remediation plans to reimburse workers (in full and in a manner that protects workers and their families from harm and retaliation), and build effective responsible recruitment systems to prevent recruitment fees from being charged to workers at any point in the hiring process. our responsible recruitment initiatives are structured around six core area: awareness raising; specialized training; case management support; risk assessment and mitigation toolkits; transparent data, analysis, and reporting; and partnerships. we offer suppliers on-site and remote support to help them understand amazon requirements, effec\u0002tively navigate the corrective action plan process, and design and implement sustainable management systems to encourage supplier monitoring throughout their supply chain. we support our suppliersâ efforts to establish data collection mechanisms, which facilitate the monitoring of progress and enable timely responses to emerging risks. we offer suppliers comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation toolkits to identify potential issues before these are surfaced during audits and allowing us to engage suppliers in a remediation process from the outset. in 2023, we launched a responsible recruit\u0002ment performance evaluation survey, consisting of a list of targeted questions to gather information on risks, controls, and recruitment agencies. where issues are identified, we offer suppliers dedicated case management support, which includes providing remediation guidebooks. for example, our recruit\u0002ment fee remediation guidebook, updated in 2023, provides suppliers with guidance on implementing a zero worker-paid recruitment fee policy, calculating fee repayment, creating effective reimbursement plans, and engaging responsible labor agents. the guidebook also includes sample language for terms of employment for clear communication between suppliers and workers. additionally, in 2023, we introduced a guidebook to assist suppliers in preventing and remediating the retention of identity documents. we believe providing suppliers with the right data, strategies, and tools helps them detect and address risks in their supply chains effectively. we encourage suppliers to participate in external training programs, such as industry association tutorials to recognize and prevent modern slavery and implement high-quality management systems. we also provide suppliers with responsible recruit\u0002ment training. in 2023, we extended our responsi\u0002ble recruitment training to our logistics and services providers and expanded offerings in additional countries that are common destinations for foreign migrant workers. working with the issara institute, microbenefits, the mekong club, and veritã©, we offered supplier training sessions on modern slavery risks and responsible recruitment practices in malaysia, saudi arabia, singapore, taiwan, thailand, and the united arab emirates. these sessions focused on topics including implementing effective risk mitigation controls, identifying issues in recruit\u0002ment and hiring processes for migrant workers, and establishing strong management systems to address and prevent these issues. human rights risks are systemic in nature; the key to addressing them is cross-industry engagement and collaboration. we engage with strategic partners responsible minerals initiative, the copper mark, and the public-private alliance for responsible minerals trade. through these partnerships, we collaborate with industry peers, governments, and civil society actors on increasing supply chain transparency and improve sourcing across mineral value chains. for more information on our responsible sourcing

training 9,970 amazon transpor\u0002tation associates in 2023. we are leveraging technology to enhance our internal programs. in 2023, we launched a new initiative to identify and proactively address forced labor and modern slavery risk indicators across our business. the program brings together employees from our human rights, ecommerce, and fraud teams to identify and eliminate instances of exploitationâ with a focus on victim safety. working with both internal and external experts in human trafficking, the cross-functional team is establishing clear protocols, mandatory training, and policies on identifying potential victims of forced labor or modern slavery within our business operations, as well as detailing what employees should do if they observe any indicators of human trafficking. these include guidance on ensuring victim safety, providing immediate support and assistance to them, as well as involving relevant we are working to constantly improve our approach to combating child labor. amazon is committed to ensuring our products and services are provided in a way that respects human rights, and combating child labor in global supply chains is an important part of that pledge. we are a member of the child rights in business working group founded by the centre for child rights in business and committed to support the joint action pledge in 2021 to strengthen the protection of childrenâs rights and accelerate actions to address child labor in global supply chains. in 2023, amazon worked with the centre to deliver an online training on child labor prevention and remediation and young worker management, to our central human rights team and key internal stakeholders. (newline)  (newline) modern slavery statement 2023 13 authorities and support organizations. more broadly, we are working to help our businesses understand how to address the root causes of any exploitation they identify within our supply chain and business practices. â¦with aws our customers use aws technology to combat modern slavery. throughout 2023, we continued to partner closely with thorn, a non-profit that builds technology to combat child sexual abuse at scale. amazon provides millions of dollars in aws credits for thorn to power its tools. thorn leverages a variety of aws solutions to support safer, a solution that uses advanced ai and machine learning models to detect child sexual abuse material (csam) at scale. safer helps companies identify, review, and report csam from content-hosting platforms. in 2023, safer helped companies detect over 3.8 million csam files. we make thornâs safer technology available to businesses via the amazon web services (aws) marketplace so they can proactively identify and address csam. in the u.s., amazon collaborates with the national center for missing and exploited children (ncmec), a child protection organization committed to aiding the search for missing children, reducing child sexual exploitation, and preventing child victimiza\u0002tion. ncmec utilizes aws technology and services to support the infrastructure of several programs. amazonâs subsidiary ring works with ncmec to distribute geo-targeted missing child posters visible in the ring neighbors app and across social media. ncmecâs missing child posters encourage users to contact proper law enforcement or ncmec if they have information that could aid in the search for a missing child. amazon serves on ncmecâs board of directors and in 2023 provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in aws credits to reliably support mission-critical applications that assist ncmecâs mission of making sure that every child has a safe childhood. amazon supports polaris, a non-profit and aws customer that leads a survivor-centered, justice- and equity-driven movement to end human trafficking in the u.s. aws provides financial and technical support to enhance polarisâs data collection and operations and improve trafficking identification and prevention. since 2007, polaris has identified over 82,300 situations of human trafficking. â¦with other organizations amazon collaborates with ngos, governments, and other companies to reduce and disrupt modern slavery. amazon is a member of the steering committee for tech against trafficking (tat), a coalition of companies and global experts working to eradicate human trafficking using technology. building on the success of the inaugural tat summit, which was hosted in 2022, the 2023 summit, titled âleveraging technology to eradicate forced laborâ, brought together over 140 global anti-trafficking leaders, including businesses, civil society, academia, government, and survivors with lived experience. panelists and experts explored how technology can eradicate forced labor and labor trafficking and how companies like amazon can prevent the misuse of technology to facilitate these crimes. in 2023, we worked with polaris and the issara instituteâboth participants of the tat acceleratorâto scale their technology solutions to address human trafficking. amazon is increasing partnerships with key multi-stakeholder initiatives. in 2023, we expanded our relationships and work with key external partners that help us advance our work on modern slavery. we joined the mekong club, a non-profit that works with the private sector to address modern slavery. through the organization, we developed a suppli\u0002er-facing remediation guide and trained vendors in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates on responsible recruitment practices. we also continued our work with the indirect spend alliance (isa), an industry working group that aims to identify oper\u0002ational areas of shared human rights risk in pro\u0002curement and design a single industry approach to addressing hotspots. we collaborate with better workâs regional teams and participate in the buyers forum and business for social responsibilityâs (bsr) human rights working group to share knowledge and learnings about our human rights issues and discuss how to address them through collective action. efforts like these are vital to understanding hotspots across our supply chain and developing impactful risk mitigation strategies that put the interests of

â¢ auditing suppliers; â¢ monitoring suppliers; â¢ developing and implementing grievance mechanisms; â¢ developing and implementing training and awareness materials on modern slavery; and â¢ engaging with supply chain partners on the issue of addressing modern slavery. policies relevant to modern slavery our business the spectris group places high priority on compliance with the legislative and ethical requirements of the countries in which we operate, particularly with respect to employment practices, labour rights and equal opportunities. the spectris plc hr director has overall responsibility for employment policies, but responsibility for implementation is delegated to individual businesses, including spectris canada, with operational policies and procedures tailored to suit local needs. spectris has several group wide policies in place which address its modern slavery compliance requirements and standards. these policies all fully apply, and are thoroughly implemented, by spectris canada. details of these policies are outlined below. spectris maintains and issues policies and guidance at a group level so that it can standardise and maintain oversight of the interactions that companies have with their suppliers. in the event that local legislation prevents compliance with group policies and guidance (which is expected to be rare), businesses are required to explain their non\u0002compliance and proposed mitigating actions and ensure that they have a dispensation from spectris plc in place. our policies include: ï¶ human rights : we believe human rights to be of the utmost importance. our human rights policy is consistent with the core conventions of the international labour organization and requires that we comply with internationally recognised human rights standards. it sets out our position on non-discrimination, harassment and forced labour. spectris canada aims to comply with internationally recognised human rights standards at all of our sites. ï¶ code of business ethics: our code of business ethics makes clear to employees the actions and behaviours expected of them when representing the organisation. all leaders, directors, functional heads, managers and supervisors are required to actively promote our code, and make time for regular discussions with their teams on how to apply it to their business. we expect our suppliers, sub-contractors, temporary workers and other third parties that we work with, to apply the principles of our code or work to their own similar standard. (newline)  (newline) 4 unrestricted document our code was updated in 2020 and includes specific safeguards against modern slavery by setting out the following responsibilities: â¢ be vigilant to ensure that all employees and anyone who works with us does so free from slavery and is safe from abuse. â¢ support all necessary human rights due diligence for any business partner you are looking to engage. â¢ if you suspect that anyoneâs human rights are being abused in connection with our business you must speak up. the code also includes a robust approach to anti-bribery and corruption. the organisation strives to maintain the highest standards of employee conduct and ethical behaviour when operating abroad and managing its supply chain. in 2023, refresher training on the code of business ethics was carried out across the group. ï¶ third party policy & procedures: within our internal spectris group manual, our third party policy & procedures mandates the standards and procedures that all employees shall follow to appoint, manage, pay and terminate any third parties that spectris and its businesses engage. ï¶ speak up policy: we encourage all workers, suppliers, customers and other business partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities, or the supply chains of the organisation. this includes any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk of modern slavery. the organisation's speak up procedure is set out in our code of business ethics and is designed to make it easy for workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation. employees, customers or other stakeholders and third parties who have concerns can use the spectris confidential helpline (www.spectrishelpline.com). the helpline can be used to report violations of the code of business ethics including modern slavery in any spectris entity and in any jurisdiction in which it operates. concerns can be raised by filling out an online form or dialling the confidential helpline numbers found on the website. supply chain management we believe that suppliers, and other business partners, should have the opportunity to benefit from their relationship with us. in practice this means that we aim to work together to minimise and manage business risk and improve business practices, through education, training and the sharing of good practice. ï¶ supplier code of conduct: the spectris global supplier code of conduct underlines our commitment to ethical business practices and sustainable supply chains. the supplier code serves as the foundation of our operations, outlining the minimum standards we expect from our valued supply chain partners and how we would like them to work with us to fulfil our wider sustainability ambitions. the code outlines our commitment to integrity, transparency, and responsibility and it provides a comprehensive framework that guides our interactions with suppliers and reinforces our core values of own it, be true and aim high. the supplier code works in tandem with our code of business ethics, creating a robust foundation for our business practices. (newline)  (newline) 5 unrestricted document our code was published in december 2023. we are confident that by collectively embracing the standards in our supplier code with our supply chain, we will strengthen our global impact and reinforce our position as a leading, sustainable business. the supplier code outlines the requirements we have of our suppliers, which include a commitment to: - uphold and demonstrate high standards of integrity, governance and business practice. - ensure that all work is voluntary. forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labour, involuntary or exploitative prison labour, slavery or trafficking of persons is not permitted. - ensure no unreasonable restrictions on workersâ freedom of movement including the requirement to lodge deposits or identity papers. - provide all workers with clear and understandable information regarding their employment and all disciplinary matters must be appropriately recorded. - not employ any person under the age for completing compulsory education, or under the minimum age for employment in the country, whichever is highest, save for the use of legitimate apprenticeships which comply with relevant laws and regulations. - verify the age of workers using an appropriate process. - provide working conditions which meet spectrisâ high standards on health, safety, hygiene and environmental practices. - pay wages and benefits which meet or exceed which meet or exceed national minimum requirements and adhere to working time regulations where applicable. - comply with spectrisâ standards and procedures in relation to anti-bribery and corruption. - not deny access to, or apply unfairly, a transparent grievance procedure. - not use any form of unlawful discrimination, harassment, abuse or bullying. - be equally demanding of their suppliers and be able to demonstrate compliance to all of the aforementioned requirements. ï¶ standard form supply contracts: wherever possible, spectris canada uses a standardised sourcing agreement which includes key principles and values expected of suppliers. the standardised sourcing agreement is then tailored to specific laws governing the jurisdictions in which the spectris group companies operate. due diligence and supply chain verification, auditing and certification in addition to due diligence processes, the spectris group conducts on-site visits to investigate the specific operations of key suppliers. this allows us to analyse a supplierâs specific practices and procedures. where risks are identified by our on-site team during these visits, this may lead to further investigations and potentially a full audit. new and potential suppliers are made aware of the spectris group compliance framework. (newline)  (newline) 6 unrestricted document risk assessment we consider the risks of modern slavery in the direct operations of spectris canada to be low. it is a very specialised and technical business. our employees are all based in canada, many of whom are highly qualified engineers and technicians. none of our workers is under the age of 18 years. likewise, we consider the risks of modern slavery within the group of suppliers of goods and services engaged by spectris canada to be relatively low. as discussed above, the vast majority of our tier 1 suppliers are located within canada. however, as spectris canada also sells the malvern panalytical, claisse and red lion products manufactured by our global spectris group, the risks within our global supply chain are relevant to spectris canada as well. spectris canada is committed to identifying and preventing all forms of modern slavery in our business and to also supporting our supply chain in achieving the same goal. to this end, we have implemented robust risk assessment procedures. for example, one of our entities screens for public information on our key suppliers, using the cloud-based risk\u0002management solution âsphera.â on-site visits and/or audits are undertaken. the spectris dd toolkit is used for the evaluation of sales channel partners and the dow jones riskcentertool is used by some businesses to verify and monitor them. the spectris group has assessed its supply chain against the top twenty countries identified in the global slavery index to assess the geographical risks of modern slavery in the groupâs supply chain. based on this assessment, the spectris group has focused attention on its manufacturing operations and key suppliers in south east asia to ensure compliance with the sa8000 social accountability standard (sa 8000). the spectris group has trained employees in the spectris asia pacific supply chain to review and support compliance with sa8000 and key suppliers have been audited against the sa8000 standard by our auditors to ensure that they have attained the certification standard. modern slavery & human trafficking training the spectris group recognises that all supply chain management staff within the organisation working in all countries need to complete risk-based modern slavery training. the group does undertake regular refresher training on the code of business ethics, including within spectris canada, which includes training on fair employment, human rights and working with partners and suppliers. in 2021, comprehensive and mandatory risk-based training on modern slavery was rolled out across the spectris group to individuals who have direct contact with the groupâs supply chain. remediation measures spectris canada has not identified any modern slavery in its operations or supply chain. as a result, we have not had to take any measures to remediate any modern slavery or to remediate a resulting loss of income for vulnerable families. spectris canada is dedicated to upholding our commitments to combat these issues while actively working to mitigate any resulting adverse impacts. (newline)  (newline) 7 unrestricted document assessment of effectiveness spectris canada recognizes that we have a responsibility to assess and mitigate the risk of modern slavery in our operations and supply chain over the long term. we are continuing to assess the risks of modern slavery in our operations and supply chains and have not yet taken any actions to assess the specific effectiveness of any actions taken in respect to modern slavery. as previously mentioned, employees all work according to a strong common framework of controls, management kpis, financial discipline and rigorous operating principles. future steps/ any other actions following the publication of our supplier code of conduct, during 2024, we will continue to refine and improve our procedures for the identification and prevention of modern slavery. approval this report was approved pursuant to subparagraph 11(4)(a) of the act by the board of directors of spectris canada inc. in accordance with the requirements of the act, and in particular section 11 thereof, i attest for and on behalf of the board of directors of spectris canada that i have reviewed the information contained in the report for the entity listed above. based on the knowledge of the board, having exercised reasonable diligence, i attest for and on behalf of the board that the information in the report is true, accurate and complete in all material respects for the purposes of the act, for the reporting period. daniel raymond president spectris canada, inc. oscar almeida director spectris canada, inc.","2021 sustainability & esg reportin it for good. keep growing.

four critical and interconnected areasâsustainable innovation; biodiversity; greenhouse gas emissions; and inclusion, diversity and equity (âid&eâ)âwhile continuing to provide transparency by periodically reporting our overall environmental, social and governance (âesgâ) performance. as we strive to address the challenges of our time, we will continue to push the boundaries of innovation to help farmers produce an abundant, affordable and resilient food supply that will help humanity thrive for generations to come. itâs a pivotal time for agriculture. a time to advance transformational change against the backdrop of these global issues: global food demand continues to grow. the united nations predicts the worldâs population will increase by 2 billion, up to 9.7 billion, by 2050.1 as our population increases, and industrial and economic development advance, the need for food will expand and change, driving pressures to convert more land and habitats to farmland to meet growing demand. farmers have more threats to their crops. changes in our climate have shifted weed, insect and disease pressures and increased extreme weather events. the 2021 global food security index, by economist impact, reported that agricultural productivity in more than half of the worldâs countries has been negatively impacted by changing rainfall patterns and excessive temperature swings.2 and society expects more from agriculture. consumers, regulators and food companies want to know where food comes from, how it was produced and that it was produced sustainably. a recent global consumer survey showed that 67 percent of respondents are concerned about the impact of food production on climate change and 79 percent prefer environmentally friendly products.3 whatâs the solution? innovation. the future of food production hinges on getting new, sustainable and productive tools and technologies into the hands of farmersâtechnology that meets these needs while minimizing negative trade-offs. âthe worldâs need for resiliency â and the development of tools to combat the pressures that inhibit the production of that foodâis fundamental.â â

timeline our vision we believe farmers are the most important stewards of the land and our natural resources. we also believe that agriculture has the power to transform the environmental, economic and social health of our planet so that we can continue to feed the world while supporting the very resources that make it all possible. agricultural technologies can help farmers produce more food while reducing environmental impact, creating more land-use choices for farmers and communities. these fundamental beliefs drive our approach to embed sustainability into our business. from our seed and crop protection products to our inclusion, diversity and equity (âid&eâ) efforts, we work to put everything we do through the filter of good for farmers, good for the planet and good for people. the challenges we face today as a society are significant. however, we believe agriculture plays a vital role in providing viable solutionsâand we know the pathway to climate positive agriculture is through a systems approach. we look forward to engaging with our stakeholders on our esg priorities and practices. growing global pressures continue to highlight the fragility of world food supply. by focusing on these four critical areas, we can harness our best science and lead meaningful, measurable efforts to support agricultural productionâfor food, fuel and fiberâas the world continues to undergo tremendous disruption. we continue to learn throughout this journey and use our voice, innovation and scale to contribute to positive and lasting change. as we evolve our approach, we remain steadfast in our commitment to advancing sustainable agriculture to enable food security and production and enrich lives and our planet for generations to come. we are evolving our focus to four critical areas that urgently need solving: sustainable innovation: innovative solutions will allow farmers to increase productivity and profitability potential, provide climate solutions and improve resilience to mounting weed, insect, disease and weather pressures. biodiversity: efforts to reduce impacts through agronomic best practices and investment in preventing future land-use change in sensitive areas to support ecological balance, agricultural productivity, climate resilience and right to operate. greenhouse gas emissions (âghgâ): science-driven action to address climate change is urgent. corteva agriscience is committed to taking steps to reduce our ghg footprint. id&e: to deliver innovative, sustainable solutions while advancing equity in agriculture, we

balance between living organisms and their ecosystems. itâs an essential part of food production and healthy ecosystems. farmers have long understood its importance. changes in biodiversity below the ground, on the farm and around it can impact yield, productivity, income and revenues for farmers and businesses throughout the food production value chain. thatâs why corteva agriscience has prioritized efforts to identify where we can advance biodiversity in a meaningful wayâby advancing products that support biodiversity, reducing the need for land-use change, enable soil biodiversity and identifying opportunities to protect pollinator habitats. work in these areas can, in turn, support crop pollination, climate regulation, healthy soil function and freshwater availability. increasing agricultural production to meet the demands of the worldâs growing population is expected to continue. this could increase the need to bring more land into food production and threaten biodiversity, but it doesnât have to. that's why weâre intending to amplify our efforts to help farmers produce more food on every acre and potentially reduce the need for land-use changes. we are

cortevaâs chief information security officer reports to the audit committee on information security matters at least annually. in addition, the company is externally audited against top information security and compliance standards using a financial reporting risk-based approach, with complete corporate scope. cortevaâs security policies are derived from globally recognized national institute

comprehensive privacy report is provided to the ethics and compliance committee annually with interim reports on a quarterly basis. like most major corporations, corteva is the target of industrial espionage, including cyber\u0002attacks, from time to time. corteva has determined that these incidents have resulted, and could result in the future, in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information. however, to date, corteva has not experienced any material financial impact, changes in its competitive environment or impact on business operations from these events. although management does not believe that corteva has experienced any material losses to date related to industrial espionage and security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that corteva will not suffer such losses in the future. corteva has had no substantiated complaints received from a regulator or outside party related to a corteva breach in 2021, as that term is defined by applicable law. corteva does not categorize events as âleaks, thefts or losses of customer dataâ and so we are unable to provide reporting for those requested categories. supply chain responsibility suppliers are required to agree or attest to our supplier code of conduct within their contract terms, including acknowledging our zero tolerance policy on human rights violations. while corteva has an important role to play in these issues, risks may occur within the supply chain. corteva, together with its worldwide subsidiaries and joint ventures, requires that all of its global vendors, contractors and suppliers of any product or raw material, wherever it originates, apply its human trafficking, child labor and forced labor principles. the supplier code of conduct and human trafficking, child labor and forced labor principles expressly outline zero tolerance on these issues, and if a company is in violation of said principles, the contract would ultimately be terminated. additionally, it is the responsibility of local management to implement and ensure compliance with these principles at corteva facilities in each region around the world. in addition, the supplier code of conduct outlines expectations for environmental partnership, including systems and reporting. our work with suppliers is supported by our membership in together for sustainability (âtfsâ) and the tools they offer to chemical companies and their suppliers, such as frameworks, tfs assessments and social and environmental tfs audits. today, there are certain additional documented processes beyond the supplier code of conduct in place to consider factors such as environmental management, health and safety in screening new suppliers or partners. the supplier code of conduct states that we will choose to work with partners who seek to implement sustainable production processes and who proactively minimize the environmental impact of their operations. additional details regarding diversity and sustainability expectations for our suppliers can be found on the supplier sustainability and diversity website and in the supplier code of conduct.

sustainability topics as identified through corteva and its external stakeholdersâ non-financial materiality assessment,1 conducted in 2019. corteva sought internal and external stakeholder input to assess the non\u0002financial materiality of relevant environmental and social topics (âsustainability topicsâ) and publicly disclosed those results. that stakeholder engagement informed the direction of the companyâs current sustainability efforts. cortevaâs sustainability topics translate the identified topics into actionable areas where the company can, through its business and practices, drive positive social and environmental progress consistent with the companyâs strategic objectives, scope and scale, and through the approach outlined in this report. the following data and information cover the activities of corteva globally, to the extent possible based on many factors such as enterprise systems or the practicality of capturing data. where data is not available on a global basis or not provided for a selected entity, it is noted with the data presented. additional activities related to environmental, social and governance topics that we consider âessential business practicesâ are discussed within this report where relevant. corteva engaged accredited 3rd party verifier sgs to complete limited external assurance on specific information within this

not conform to u.s. gaap and are considered non-gaap measures. these measures include operating ebitda. management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting, including allocating resources and evaluating incentive compensation. management believes that these non-gaap measures best reflect the ongoing performance of the company during the periods presented and provide additional more relevant and meaningful information to investors as they provide insight with respect to ongoing operating results of the company and a more useful comparison of year-over-year results. these non-gaap measures supplement the companyâs u.s. gaap disclosures and should not be viewed as an alternative to u.s. gaap measures of performance. furthermore, such non-gaap measures may not be consistent with similar measures provided or used by other companies. reconciliations for these non-gaap measures to u.s. gaap are provided below. operating ebitda is defined as earnings

non-operating benefits (costs) consists of non-operating pension and opeb benefits (costs), tax indemnification adjustments, environmental remediation and legal costs associated with legacy businesses and sites, and the 2021 officer indemnification payment. tax indemnification adjustments relate to changes in indemnification balances, as a result of the application of the terms of the tax matters agreement, between corteva and dow and/or dupont that are recorded by the company as pre-tax income or expense. net unrealized gain or loss from mark-to-market activity for certain foreign currency derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting represents the non-cash net gain (loss) from changes in fair value of certain undesignated foreign currency derivative contracts. upon settlement, which is within the same calendar year of execution of the contract, the realized gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the non-qualified foreign currency derivative contracts will be reported in the relevant non-gaap financial measures, allowing quarterly results to reflect the economic effects of the foreign currency derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark

(newline)  (newline) 2022/23 modern slavery statement burberry group plc we believe that respect for human rights is fundamental to modern business. the prevention of forced, bonded and trafficked labour is a core element of burberryâs human rights policy and ethical trading code of conduct. burberry policies the responsible business principles (the âprinciplesâ) have been developed in line with our commitments and experience over many years. they have been informed by our longstanding membership of the united nationsâ global compact, and are underpinned by the eti base code, international bill of human rights and the fundamental conventions of the international labour organisation. we review and update the principles on an annual basis to ensure that they align to the latest best practice guidelines and any emerging regulatory requirements. the principles apply to all our business associates, which include, but are not limited to: raw material suppliers, finished goods vendors, subcontractors, supporting facilities, non-stock suppliers, construction contractors, licensees and franchisees. the principles are overseen by burberryâs ethics committee, chaired by our general counsel, and are monitored by our responsibility and supply chain teams. the principles include burberry code of ethical business principles, anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy and global environmental policy, and the following seven policies: policies policies policies burberry group plc (newline)  (newline) policies burberry group plc 2022/23 modern slavery statement burberry group plc human rights policy burberryâs human rights policy sets out the procedures we have put in place to protect and uphold human rights, including mechanisms in place to address any instances of potential infringement, across four key stakeholder groups â our people, workers in our supply chain, our customers and our communities. the policy was developed with reference to the united nationsâ guiding principles on business and human rights. we assess human rights impacts and monitor labour conditions in both our own operations and our supply chain on a regular basis to ensure the policy is upheld. further details of burberryâs human rights policy are available here: burberry human rights policy. migrant worker policy this is specifically intended to protect workers who may be vulnerable to exploitation during international and national migration. the policy contains requirements including, but not limited to, the prohibition of withholding passports and similar documents and the levying of recruitment fees. during fy 2020/21, we updated this policy based on learnings from partnering with issara institute, an ngo specialised on recruitment journeys for migrant workers in supply chains. we then recommunicated this policy to business associates to provide more detailed guidance on implementation of the policy and meeting the standards within it. the full migrant worker policy is available here: burberry migrant worker policy. ethical trading code of conduct this outlines requirements which all our business associates must uphold in relation to their own employees, contracted labour and throughout their own supply chain. the code includes, amongst other standards, the following requirements: that employment is freely chosen, child labour is not used, freedom of association is respected and no harsh or inhumane treatment occurs. the full ethical trading code of conduct is available here: burberry ethical trading code of conduct. child labour and young worker policy we prohibit all forms of child labour in our own operations and throughout our supply chain. in our ethical trading code of conduct, we state that we will never use child labour and outline provisions for young workers. our child labour and young worker policy expands on the ethical trading code of conduct and includes standards relating to implementation, monitoring and remediation procedures which must be followed by all business associates. further details of the child labour and young worker policy are available here: burberry child labour and young worker policy.

(newline)  (newline) 2022/23 modern slavery statement burberry group plc human rights due diligence assessing our human rights impact every two years, we conduct a human rights impact assessment (hria) of our operations and activities and those of our extended supply chain. if a forced labour risk is identified, ethical trading assessments are conducted by our internal teams or by a local ngo, where local expertise is needed, to identify any labour rights issues and remediation required. we have implemented this process since 2014 and continue to evolve and develop our human rights diligence approach, as well as our ethical trading programme. as part of this, over the last two years we have implemented several mitigation action plans focused on the three highlighted areas from our fy 2020/21 assessment: on diversity, equity and inclusion, we have strengthened our partnership with cultural mediators and provided migrant workers with tools to expand their awareness about public services and facilitate access to them. in relation to worker voice, we have continued to sponsor our hotlines, which remain a key tool to capture workersâ needs. over the last year, we have also expanded the hotlinesâ reach to new countries and more workers within our raw material supply chain. finally, in response to modern slavery risks, we monitor our policies to ensure they remain relevant, we strictly implement our due diligence process at onboarding and we keep refining our audit tools. we also conduct training for both internal teams and supply chain partners to raise awareness and provide tools to prevent and mitigate this risk. human rights due diligence human rights due diligence burberry group plc diversity, equity and inclusion worker voice modern slavery (newline)  (newline) human rights due diligence burberry group plc 2022/23 modern slavery statement burberry group plc our latest impact assessment took place in q4 of fy 2022/23, where in addition to our standard assessment, we conducted a supplementary analysis with a specific lens looking at where migrant workersâ human rights may mostly be affected. this assessment also included considerations related to the ungaâs recognition of the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment, under international law. we used this opportunity to explore what this could mean for the workers throughout our supply chain, who carry out a variety of manufacturing processes, in many different environments across the world. these assessments identified the following salient key areas where human rights violations are more likely to be identified across our finished goods and raw materials suppliers. these are: as we move into the next year, we will continue to build out our action plans to further address these risk areas, as well as driving a clear focus on ensuring our business practices have a positive impact on workers in the supply chain. to ensure our hria methodology remains comprehensive and continues to provide us with a material assessment of burberryâs operational human rights footprint, we are working closely with an external consultant, to revise and enhance our methodology. traceability we are developing a traceability programme for raw materials. this will enable us to more closely assess and manage the social impacts of raw material sourcing. as part of the programme, we have implemented a traceability pilot project with some of our key cotton suppliers, using a third-party traceability tool which tracks the cotton back to the farm and country of origin. we will extend this trial in the coming year, with an aim to have full traceability of key raw materials by fy 2029/30. this is also aligned with our existing raw material and traceability targets, which we are currently on track to achieve by fy 2029/30. see our annual report fy 2022/23 for further details of our targets and progress on raw material traceability and certification. due diligence and assessment of our supply chain our due diligence model includes and combines the activities we put in place to identify and manage social risks in our product supply chains. we review our due diligence model regularly to ensure it meets the expectations of our external stakeholders such as consumers, investors and governments and to ensure ongoing alignment to legislation. supply chain partner on boarding all our supply chain partners and their supporting facilities are screened and assessed at the onboarding stage to identify any human rights and modern slavery risk. we require all our partners to acknowledge and sign burberryâs responsible business principles to ensure mutual agreement that any form of modern slavery, included forced, bonded or involuntary prison labour, is not permitted under any circumstances. adherence to the principles is included in our contracts with suppliers. they sign a letter of undertaking confirming, amongst other matters, their commitment to the principles and responsibility to cascade the principles within their own supply chains. right from the onboarding stage, they are also required to agree that we may visit and assess their own compliance and that of their suppliers at any time. before any new supply chain partner is approved, they are risk assessed for social compliance and any indication of forced, bonded or trafficked labour. for raw material suppliers, if during this risk assessment a vulnerable workforce or geographical location risk is identified, a full audit will be completed and the results and the remediation plans (if any) will be evaluated before a decision on providing approval is made. should remediation be unsuccessful at any stage and a supplier not meet our strict criteria, we do not pursue any working relationship with them. working and living conditions, including access to health services worker voice â specific to providing remedy diversity, equity and

and assessments we continually assess human rights risks and labour conditions across our global supply chain through monitoring and verification activities as part of our ethical trading programme, which was established in 2004. before a new supply chain partner is approved to work with burberry, we assess its compliance with the principles and applicable local laws and commitment to uphold them. such assessment includes an ethical trading audit. we have a team of ethical trading experts within our responsibility team who carry out ethical audits across our supply chain, and are supported by interpreters and cultural facilitators where required. external accredited auditing agencies are also appointed to conduct audits in some cases. audits, announced or unannounced, consist of worker interviews, document reviews and site tours, and are repeated periodically to confirm ongoing compliance and continuous improvement. the frequency of audits depends on the level of performance in previous audits â better performing factories are audited less frequently, whereas facilities where more severe non\u0002conformities are identified are audited every three to six months. between audits, our responsibility team works closely with facilities to support the implementation of required improvements and to implement systems to prevent modern slavery, as well as to improve the management of human rights and health and safety risks. during the fy 2022/23, we conducted 449 audits and 19 engagement activities across our finished goods and raw material supply chains. all our partners are provided with an approved corrective action plan that is closely monitored and supported by our teams, who work with the facilities on a continuous improvement plan. this year, the main areas of non-conformance with our standards related to health & safety and working hours, and we will continue to work with our partners to identify the root cause of these issues, and implement actions to address them. our audits also address the risk posed by unauthorised subcontracting. as a global organisation, we accept our responsibility to support and guide our partners by raising awareness of associated risks of modern slavery at subcontractors. our partners have extended the no-tolerance policy of unauthorised subcontracting to all of their partnerships and in some cases implemented digital tracking systems to prevent outsourcing. human rights due diligence (newline)  (newline) burberry group plc 2022/23 modern slavery statement burberry group plc we have also continued to extend the scope of our ethical audit programme to cover logistics and distribution centres, service providers and suppliers of gnfr, where we identify risks based on location, worker demographic or processes carried out at the facility. in fy 2022/23, we carried out ethical audits at gifting and marketing vendors, suppliers of packaging and visual merchandising suppliers, and we will continue to enhance our risk mitigation in this area of our supply chain. additional supply chain activites burberry understands that utilising an auditing approach alone to due diligence, does not always lead to sustainable change. therefore we have implemented several additional programmes to support our partnersâ capabilities to identify, manage and prevent social risks within their own facilities and extended supply chains. ethical trading capacity building programme in order to promote ethical audits through further tiers of our supply chain, we continue to extend our capacity building programme, named the vendor ownership programme. this supports key supply chain partners in the emeia region to adopt their own ethical audit programmes across their own supply chain. thanks to our vendorsâ continued engagement, along with extensive support and training, the programme is a key pillar for ensuring burberryâs ethical standards are met in our supply chain. by developing a collaborative and mutually supportive approach with our vendors, we have achieved a hugely positive impact in identifying, assessing, preventing and mitigating risks within our supply chain. regular audits focused on human rights as well as health and safety are conducted both by our vendorsâ appointed resources and our internal responsibility team, against the ethical trading code of conduct. based on the results of the audit, improvement action plans are developed, and shared with the vendorsâ support facilities, who work on bridging the gaps identified. we ensure a continuous in-depth analysis and investigation of supply chain related issues through training sessions, which are facilitated by burberry and delivered both by the burberry responsibility team and external consultants â designed upon vendorsâ needs and to respond to external challenges. the programme is now in place at 22 vendors (21 in italy and 1 in uk) reaching over 16,500 workers across 252 subcontractors, covering 47% of our emeia product supply chain. worker wellbeing programme we aim to engage our supply chain partners in programmes that support the wellbeing of workers across our supply chain. in fy 2022/23, eight key finished good vendors in italy and seven key manufacturing facilities based in china, vietnam and thailand participated in our worker wellbeing programme, which we first launched in 2018. this has covered over 5,000 workers in our supply chain during fy 2022/23. by focussing on worker wellbeing, we aim to help our suppliers to improve employee satisfaction and attract and retain talent. the programme has included: â¢ training sessions and workshops for site managers to increase knowledge about worker wellbeing. â¢ a survey to measure worker wellbeing, which was originally developed in partnership with oxfam and adapted over time. this covers topics such as happiness at work, job satisfaction, personal and professional development, and physical wellbeing. an additional section was added for the apac region focusing on how the covid-19 pandemic has affected workers wellbeing. our corporate responsibility team has worked with the participating sites to review survey results and encourage them to develop specific action plans (in consultation with workers) to drive improvement. we also monitor implementation of the action plans. in response to the feedback, our suppliers have made various improvements over the past year such as development of worker and supervisor training programmes and initiatives to promote internal dialogue. next year we plan to extend the programme to cover more supply chain partners and will encourage participants to cascade the project across their own supply chain where applicable. human rights due diligence wellbeing programme reached over 5,000 workers (newline)  (newline) burberry group plc 2022/23 modern slavery statement burberry group plc dual capacity building initiative for migrant workers we have started a new dual capacity building initiative to support the ethical recruitment, employment and integration of migrant workers across our european supply chain. this aims to both educate management across our vendors as well as build awareness with workers. we have developed a grievance mechanism for migrant minorities, which has been designed with the support of experts in modern slavery. this provides a confidential channel for migrant workers to identify, report and address potential instances of modern slavery. we plan to pilot this with nine supply chain partners in fy 2023/24. a training programme has been developed for our supply chain partners, in collaboration with the international organisation for migration (iom). this is designed to help educate our vendors and raw material suppliers on how to ensure the protection of migrant workers, with a specific focus on their recruitment journey. it includes a deep dive on diversity and inclusion best practices in order to support the integration of migrant workers into the local workshop population. in total, this training reached 77 supply chain partners and impacted 9,500 workers in fy 2022/23. this included 37 of our first-tier partners in italy and eight direct partners of our italian owned manufacturing facility, burberry manifattura and 100% of first tier and second tier partners in poland, romania and moldova. across our supply chain partners, attendees included managers, human resources teams and internal auditors. in addition, 100% of our vendor ownership programme auditors (21), as well as burberry auditors, have been trained to identify red flags and deep dive into recruitment dynamics. based on the positive feedback received by attendees, we are currently exploring new opportunities for creating a longer-term partnership with iom on enhancing due diligence and migrant workers voice on a more permanent basis, across the whole impacted value chain. living wage burberry is committed to the promotion and adoption of a living wage in our own operations and supply chain and is proud to become the first luxury retailer and manufacturer to achieve accreditation as a uk living wage employer. in 2016, burberry joined the global living wage initiative, which works to address in-work poverty across all sectors and multiple geographies, as part of a unified, global approach with multi stakeholder participation. in 2022, we brought forward the new uk real living wage pay rates as defined by the living wage foundation by more than six months. several of our uk suppliers are living wage employers, including our longest standing partner johnstonâs of elgin, manufacturers of burberryâs heritage cashmere scarves. human rights due diligence training reached 9,500 workers

have access to confidential support and advice. we provide grievance mechanisms for our employees, including a global helpline which is managed by an independent company. we also sponsor confidential hotlines run by ngos for workers in our supply chain, which provide advice on workersâ rights and wellbeing and confidential support. during fy 2022/23, burberry sponsored hotlines received 502 calls (467 calls in fy 2021/22). these included 18 complaints, 464 consulting requests and 20 psychological support requests. all calls have either been responded to by the ngo that operates the hotline and/or the factories to address the workersâ concern. grievance resolution is monitored by the responsibility team. next year, we will continue to look for opportunities to expand hotline support. our ethical trading code of conduct also recognises the right for employees to join trade unions and collective bargaining. over 70% of the finished goods facilities we source from are covered by national and/or industrial collective bargaining agreements and many have established union representation, enabling workers to remain informed and involved in discussions about their rights. migrant worker documentation concern a worker contacted the hotline and raised a concern that their working visa documentation had expired for some time, but their factory management was yet to help them renew it. the hotline facilitator communicated with the factory representative and noted that the queue of renewal application was significant, due to the local embassy having been closed for more than 2 years during the covid-19 pandemic and had only recently re-opened. the hotline transferred the message to the worker explaining the reasons of delay and reassured them about their concerns. the factory management also conducted a meeting with all their migrant workers to explain the situation and regularly reported the progress of the renewal status of their documents. to date, all the documents have been renewed and the workerâs concerns have been resolved. the below is an example of a case received from hotline in fy 2022/23 and how the concern was resolved: human rights

governance appendix 90 governance describe the boardâs oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. as indicated in its committee charter, the corporate governance and nominating (cgn) committee of our board oversees and periodically reviews the companyâs environmental, social and governance (esg) programs, policies and practices, which includes our environmental initiatives. the committee oversees environmental targets, strategy, and performance, and reviews potential environmental risks and opportunities, including those related to climate change. at least twice a year, the cgn committee is briefed by the vice president, chief sustainability officer, on behalf of our global business conduct council (gbcc). the briefings include information about netappâs esg strategy, goals, progress towards those goals, netappâs esg report and other initiatives relating to netappâs esg pro\u0002gram, policies and practices, including initiatives relating to climate-related issues. the cgn committee also seeks and reviews input from critical stakeholders, including with respect to climate-related risks and opportunities. the board-level audit committee is responsible for periodically reviewing and discussing with management our enterprise risk management (erm) process. the committee receives regular briefings from our executive risk committee (erc) and from the vp of internal audit regarding the risks relating to the companyâs business and operations, including climate-related risks. in the event that a sig\u0002nificant risk arises, the audit committee may bring that risk and its mitigation plans before the full board of directors. for more details on the governance of climate-related issues, refer to our cdp responses on the cdp website. describe managementâs role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. we maintain a companywide erm process to help us recognize and manage potential risks. netappâs erm program has two governing bodies - the audit committee and the erc. the erm process is managed by our erc, a cross-functional group of senior leaders with responsibility for top-level risks, including those related to climate change. the erc is the coordinating body that oversees netappâs response to risks that could impact netappâs ability to achieve its overarching strategic goals, as well as its underlying business objectives. the erc consists of representatives from each of the five risk pillars (strategic, operational, financial, compliance, and human capital), members of executive management, and the erm risk manager. indi\u0002vidual risk owners share their functionâs top risks with the erc quarterly. the erc has clearly defined categories of risk, including moderate, major, and catastrophic. if the risk is significant, the board is informed at the annual audit committee meeting, or sooner, if necessary. the erc is responsible for: â¢ identifying climate-related risks; â¢ assigning ownership of climate-related risks; â¢ approving risk mitigation strategies and resource allocations to manage risks as appropriate; â¢ ensuring stakeholders are adequately informed about the long-term, risk-adjusted business strategy; and â¢ escalating significant risks and risk events to the board as needed. tcfd (newline)  (newline) introduction products environment people dei&b social impact governance appendix 91 strategy describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term. our erm process allows us to identify, assess, and respond to climate-related risks using defined time horizons: â¢ short-term: 0-2 years â¢ medium-term: 2-5 years â¢ long-term: 5-10 years our process is the same for all time horizons, though we escalate response and mitigation if there is a short-term substantive risk that needs to be addressed. netapp has identified the following risks: acute and chronic physical risks, increased energy costs, current and emerging regulations, including enhanced emissions-reporting obligations, reputational risks, legal risks, and technology-related risks, especially those related to innovations to reduce our carbon footprint. netapp has identified the following opportunities: development of new products and services through r&d and innovation, procurement of renewable energy for facilitiesâ electricity sources, and moving to more energy-efficient buildings/labs. a detailed description of climate-related risks and opportunities is found in our cdp responses on the cdp website. we also address climate-related risks in the environmental disclosure and risk factors sections of our 10-k filing, pages 11, 20, 22, and 28. describe the impact of climate\u0002related risks and opportunities on the organizationâs businesses, strategy, and financial planning. sustainability factors into our short- and long-term business planning and is a key consideration in developing our product strategy. our efforts to produce more sustainable products and servicesâ and help our customers meet their own sustainability goalsâare described in detail in the products section of our esg report. our investments in technologies that help us reduce our environmental footprint are described in the environment section of our esg report. one example of how climate-related risks and opportunities have impacted our strategy is our focus on cloud migration. as enterprise data centers continue to migrate to the cloud, netapp is uniquely positioned in this market transformation, and it has become an integral part of our long-term strategic planning. the benefit of cloud migration is that data centers in locations that have significant climate-related risk exposure can transition to data centers located in areas with fewer risks. additionally, large public clouds have built their data centers to be on average 3.6 times more energy efficient than those of enterprises, and cloud providers like aws, microsoft azure, and google cloud have made carbon neutrality pledges. netapp is the only storage company with oem agreements with these three cloud providers, enabling customers to simply migrate data, workloads, or portions of workloads to the public cloud. our systems are cloud connectable so that customers can move data to a public cloud, whether old data for archiving, protecting data via backup/disaster recovery copies, or caching dataâreaping the environmental benefits of cloud migration. we continue to enhance our cloud operations tool set (including our bluexp sustainability dashboard), enabling customers to automatically use and turn off cloud services to optimize their infrastructure, in turn reducing hardware usage, as well as reducing space and energy consumption. to address interruptions caused by climate-related supply chain challenges or physical risks, we insist that our contract manufacturers globally have business continuity plans ready for natural disasters, and we review those plans with them regularly. we have diversified our supply chain to adapt if a natural disaster impacts a particular regionâs production. our contract manufacturers are situated across three key regions: the americas, emea, and apac. in case of a significant disruption in one area, our intention is for other locations to step in to handle the workload and meet customer demands while a long-term continuity plan is executed. climate-related risks have also impacted cost planning due to increased temperatures. we use outside air to cool our data centers and labs, which allows us to purchase less electricity that would otherwise be needed to run chillers, pumps, and cooling tower fans. rising temperatures, however, create less favorable conditions for using outside air cooling. therefore, we must forecast increased purchased electricity spend. we provide more details on how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced our business, strategy, and financial planning in our cdp responses on the cdp website. describe the resilience of the organizationâs strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2â°c or lower scenario since 2021, we have focused on building out our esg programs, policies, and processes to help establish reporting, drive results, and set climate-related goals. our early efforts focused on a materiality assessment and developing decarbonization strategies. we expect to incorporate climate-based scenario analysis into our risk evaluation program in the next two years. tcfd (newline)  (newline) introduction products environment people dei&b social impact governance appendix 92 risk management describe the organizationâs processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. we maintain a companywide erm program to help us recognize and manage potential risks. this process includes an annual risk assessment, which begins with a broad evaluation of all potential risks and ends with a narrowed list of top-level risks. risks are deemed to be relevant if they could impact the achievement of our strategy or business objectives, as described in our cdp responses on the cdp website. to identify risks, business units from across the company take part in our annual erm process. executives representing various business units are assigned as risk owners and are responsible for reviewing megatrends, conducting swot analyses, and reviewing the regulatory environment, among other tasks, to evaluate existing and new risks. to ensure each risk is evaluated consistently, netapp uses risk likelihood and risk impact measurement criteria to evaluate the raw risk score for each risk. netapp then determines the effectiveness of the controls to develop a residual risk score. for more information on our approach to risk management, refer to our cdp responses on the cdp website. describe the organizationâs processes for managing climate\u0002related risks. netapp believes in being proactive, rather than reactive, to manage climate-related risks. we take necessary precautions to mitigate risks. once risks are identified, they are prioritized, and the risk owner and/or risk liaisons will recommend an appropriate course of action. there are three actions in response to a risk: 1. terminate: eliminate the risk to zero, usually by avoidance. 2. treat: mitigate the risk, taking action to reduce either the likelihood of a risk occurring, the impact if the risk occurs, or transferring the risk to a third party (i.e., insurance). 3. tolerate: make a conscious decision to accept the risk. more details on our risk management process are described above and in our cdp responses on the cdp website. describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organizationâs overall risk management. we integrate climate-related risks and opportunities into our companywide erm process. risks identified at the enterprise level are managed in accordance with the processes described above and in our cdp responses on the cdp website. our committees and board members meet regularly to discuss these risks, including with the applicable risk owners, and the management or mitigation of such risks. tcfd (newline)  (newline) introduction products environment people dei&b social impact governance appendix 93 metrics and targets disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate\u0002related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process. we measure and disclose scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, as these emissions help us understand our footprint in order to target meaningful reductions. we also maintain emissions reduction targets, as well as targets related to energy use and water, which we believe help to mitigate a range of risks, including regulatory and reputational risks. disclose scope 1, scope 2, and, if appropriate, scope 3 greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, and the related risks. our scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, as well as information regarding reduction targets and plans, can be found on page 26. describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate\u0002related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. we have three active emissions targets, as well as targets related to energy management and water use. these targets, as well as our progress, are described below. 1. establish science-based targets as part of our initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: in 2024, we committed to set an emissions reduction target aligned with the science based targets initiative (sbti), doing our part to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees celsius. 2. reduce scope 1 and scope 2 absolute emissions by approximately 42% by 2030: we have achieved significant carbon emissions reductions, decreasing our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 37% from our baseline (fy20). 3. reduce scope 3 emissions intensity by 50% by 2030: in fy23, netapp joined the cdp supply chain program and conducted a baseline scope 3 supplier survey. in fy24, we launched a supplier engagement initiative to more accurately account for our scope 3 emissions. equipped with documented supplier emissions data, we conducted focused supplier engagements to review their activities and management processes and to refine our scope 3 baseline calculation. the information collected through cdp contributed to shaping the foundation of the new comprehensive sustainability supplier program to be launched in fy25. 4. energy management: we look to use renewable energy to power our offices around the world wherever feasible. as of fy23, we have increased our renewable energy use by 144% as compared to our fy20 baseline. 5. use reclaimed water for operations in highly water-stressed areas: at our research triangle park campus, located in a region facing water stress, lab/data center cooling is the siteâs primary use for water. in fy23, we started a project to transition to reclaimed, non-potable water for cooling. this year, the siteâs cooling towers were transitioned to use reclaimed water, saving more than 6.5 million gallons of potable water in fy24 (45% of the siteâs total consumption). tcfd (newline)  (newline)

(newline)  (newline) environment garmin has a global environmental policy1 and is committed to protecting the environment throughout all aspects of our business. as discussed below, we continually evaluate and improve our performance by establishing objectives that conserve resources, reduce our impact on the environment, and fulfill requirements. the garmin board of directors provides oversight and governance on all business matters, including sustainability and environmental, social and governance (esg) strategies. our executive leadership team provides direction on esg strategies, oversight of the implementation of esg initiatives and regularly updates the board of directors on esg matters. active involvement from our board of directors and executive leadership team ensures that esg priorities are integrated into business decisions and throughout the organization. garmin is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through direct carbon emissions reduction and elimination strategies. as part of our due diligence related to these efforts, we monitor our carbon emissions in our owned facilities and primary manufacturing and distribution facilities. more than 90% of our tracked carbon emissions from these sites are from the use of electricity. garmin takes the opportunity to directly reduce our carbon emissions through renewable electricity sources where available to us under reasonable terms and conditions, and to reduce energy usage where we find opportunities to do so. during 2023, our 20-year agreement with our utility company in kansas continued to provide our olathe, kansas, campus with 9.8 megawatts of renewable wind energy, resulting in 100% renewable energy utilization for this site. more than a dozen of our facilities and offices around the world utilize renewable energy sources, and we reduced our emissions in 2023 by more than 26,000 metric tons of co2e2 through the use of renewable energy. garmin implements environmentally friendly design elements in new construction projects, including the use of natural light, led fixtures, high-efficiency hvac equipment, and low-flow water systems. in 2023, garmin also collected and recycled approximately 5,000 metric tons of materials, including paper, cardboard, plastic and electronic waste, from our facilities. our manufacturing facilities in taiwan, where the majority of our products are produced, have all achieved international organization for standardization (iso) 50001 certification for energy management systems. the iso 50001 standard sets requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving an energy management system, enabling organizations to continually reduce their energy consumption, energy costs, and environmental impact. additionally, garmin has implemented environmental management systems to improve resource efficiency, reduce waste, and reduce costs and has achieved certification to the iso 14001 standard for environmental management at facilities in the u.s., u.k., taiwan, poland, and china. we also engineer our products with energy sustainability in mind, while aiming to satisfy customer demands for rich features. in 2023 we continued to expand our solar charging power glassâ¢ technology to more of our products, which can significantly reduce the energy used by these products and the need to charge their batteries from the grid. for example, the instinct 2â® solar smartwatch offers unlimited battery life in smartwatch mode using only the energy harvested from sunlight3. the addition of solar charging also benefits customers who can do what they love longer without worrying about frequent charging. in 2023 we shipped more than one million of these products. we also introduced the descentâ¢ g1 solar â ocean edition in 2023, a watch-style dive computer with eco-friendly construction. one hundred percent of the plastic used to make the watchâs housing, bezel and buttons come from recycled ocean-bound plastics. the research and development that went into perfecting the use of ocean-bound plastics in our products paves the way to use recycled materials on additional product lines in the future. our products are built to last, and we also support our customers who want to responsibly recycle garmin products that have reached the end of their useful life. depending on country or region, customers can deliver their device to garmin for us to responsibly dispose of or recycle. when possible, garmin reuses components and refurbishes products returned through our product support system as part of our recertification process while ensuring the durability and reliability customers expect of our products. over the past five years, our main refurbishing facility has averaged an 83% refurbish rate for returned damaged products. for high-volume products such as our multisport smartwatches, we are able to reuse approximately 85% of components from returned damaged items. garmin faces a number of risks related to climate change, including natural disasters and extreme weather events, regulatory and legislative measures, requirements of our oem (original equipment manufacturer) customers or other strategic partners, and evolving societal pressures. in response to these risks, garmin has developed backup and recovery plans, retained insurance against certain losses, diversified our suppliers where possible to mitigate supply chain disruptions, and continually innovates and seeks opportunities to provide products and technologies that will meet customer expectations. please refer to our 2023 form 10-k, in particular part i, item 1a, for additional information on the risks and uncertainties facing the company.

please refer to our 2023 form 10-k, in particular part i, item 1a, for additional information on the risks and uncertainties facing the company. employees garmin employs approximately 19,900 individuals in 34 countries. successful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing, and retaining key employees and members of our management team. to facilitate talent attraction and retention, we provide opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by generous compensation and benefits, in a safe and healthy working environment. we invest significant resources in our talent development programs to provide employees with the training and education they need to achieve their career goals, build relevant skills, and bring value to their teams. to support this, we provide many employee benefits, which vary by country or region, such as education assistance as well as leadership and professional development courses. garminâs business resource groups in the u.s. provide opportunities for employees to connect, network, and become involved in community engagement initiatives. we also offer a range of benefits to our employees that enable us to attract and retain leading talent. in addition to salaries, these programs, which vary by country or region, include stock compensation, savings plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and an employee stock purchase plan, which provides employees an opportunity to acquire company ownership for a discounted price. in 2023, our benefits package for u.s. employees scored 32% higher than the median value of a comparator group of high-tech companies based on an analysis conducted by mercer, the largest u.s. human resources consulting firm. during 2023, our u.s. employees participated in a company-wide survey performed by flex surveys, and rated garmin on a range of metrics, including company culture and compensation and benefits. in the final results garmin scored in the top 20% among comparable companies. we believe our investments in our employees contribute to our relatively low turnover rate for a company in the technology industry. the average turnover across the company for the most recent reporting period was approximately 12%(5). we were recently recognized by forbes, who ranked garmin as number 2 on their 2024 list of best large employers in america. (newline)  (newline) garmin has a global health and safety policy1 and we are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace that promotes the wellbeing of our employees. we continually evaluate our processes to ensure they fulfill requirements and educate and engage with our employees to implement improvements that prevent work-related incidents and illnesses, eliminate hazards and mitigate risks. garmin has also achieved certification to the iso 45001 standard, an internationally recognized certification for management systems of occupational health and safety, at facilities in the u.s., taiwan, poland, and china. as a reflection of garmin health and safety practices, our total recordable injury rate (trir) is consistently well below industry averages. trir, as defined by the united states occupational safety and health administration, is the total number of recordable injuries and illnesses per 100 full-time equivalent workers during a one-year period. in 2023 our trir among our manufacturing and distribution locations that have achieved iso 45001 certification was approximately 0.23. this value is approximately 2.2 times11 better than most recent industry averages as provided by the u.s. bureau of labor statistics. as outlined in our global code of conduct6, garmin is committed to supporting a diverse workforce at all levels of the company. as a global company with offices in more than 30 different countries around the world, diversity and inclusion play an important role in our culture, business operations, and ability to create innovative new products and services. for additional information on garminâs employee diversity and inclusion, please refer to our sustainability accounting standards board (sasb) report on our sustainability reporting webpage7 . our future success depends significantly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, and administrative personnel. recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position can be challenging. please refer to our 2023 form 10-k, in particular part i, item 1a, for additional information on the risks and uncertainties facing the company. human rights as outlined in our global human rights policy1, garmin is committed to upholding human rights and freedoms for all people, including the right to experience safe, fair, and nondiscriminatory working conditions. we are committed to complying with all applicable laws and adhering to prevailing industry standards, and we expect the same of our suppliers. in accordance with our modern slavery policy8 , garmin condemns modern slavery in all forms and prohibits acts that constitute modern slavery. we have standards and procedures in place and require employees to report any suspected instances of modern slavery. our global employee code of conduct requires our employees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, which include those regarding modern slavery and human trafficking. we are committed to educating our workforce about modern slavery and human trafficking and ensuring compliance with applicable laws. additionally, our factories are subject to periodic compliance audits by many of our distributors and other resellers to confirm our compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and international labor and human rights standards. our supplier code of conduct(9) addresses supplier policies on labor and human rights issues including modern slavery. additionally, our standard supply agreements require suppliers to assure us that products they supply are not produced, manufactured or packaged by forced, prison or child labor. garmin conducts periodic assessments of our suppliers to assess and verify compliance with our supplier code of conduct and other supply chain requirements. these assessments include evaluations of compliance with policies implemented to prevent child labor, forced labor and other human rights issues. garmin has also evaluated our supply chain to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect child labor, pursuant to the requirements of art. 964j of the swiss code of obligations. as a result of the analysis performed, we have determined that there are not reasonable grounds to suspect garminâs products or services have been manufactured or provided using child labor. garmin also takes steps to ensure our supply chain is free of conflict minerals, which include tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, also known as 3tg. although garmin does not directly purchase any raw 3tg minerals from our suppliers, garmin purchases component parts from its suppliers that could include 3tg derived from mines in the democratic republic of congo (drc) or adjoining countries. garmin designed its due diligence measures in conformance with the due diligence related steps of the organisation for economic co-operation and development (\"oecd\") due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflict\u0002affected and high-risk areas, as further set forth in the specific guidance for downstream companies contained in the supplements on tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. garmin expects each of our suppliers to adopt a policy of responsible sourcing of minerals and pass this requirement through its supply chain. garmin responds to identified risks when there is reason to believe that conflict minerals included in its products may have originated in the drc or an adjoining country and are not from recycled or scrap sources. for additional information on garminâs policies and procedures regarding conflict minerals, please refer to our conflict minerals policy10 and our conflict minerals report on our sustainability reporting webpage7. as a business that operates worldwide, we are subject to complex and changing global laws and regulations, including those related to health and safety, labor and employment, import, export and trade. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable global laws and regulations, including those discussed above. please refer to our 2023 form 10-k, in particular part i, item 1a, for additional information on the risks and uncertainties facing the company. (newline)  (newline) business conduct garmin is committed to conducting business in a manner fully consistent with our ethical standards and legal obligations. garmin is also committed to complying with all anti-corruption laws of the countries in which it does business, such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act 2010 and articles 322ter â 322decies of the swiss criminal code (cp). garmin is committed to conducting its activities free from the illegal and improper influence of bribery and to ensuring anti-corruption awareness among its employees, as well as third parties with respect to their activities related to garmin. in accordance with our code of conduct6, garmin empowers our employees to identify corruption risk and to respond appropriately. employees are expected to be aware of local law requirements, follow the companyâs approval process for transactions, refuse and report to garminâs chief compliance officer any requests for bribes or facilitating payments, and ensure any expenses for government officials are appropriate. our employees are provided with mandatory annual trainings that includes the education and resources they need to be informed of and to adhere to applicable regulations and garminâs compliance policies. additionally, our employees are required to acknowledge on an annual basis that they have reviewed the code of conduct and understand they are expected to comply with all of the rules therein. garmin employees are encouraged to report any potential compliance concern and may do so anonymously through garminâs compliance hotline where permitted by local law. garminâs chief compliance officer has overall responsibility for the companyâs anti-corruption compliance program and the related guidelines. these guidelines are in place so neither garmin nor any of its agents, partners or representatives will give, offer, receive or solicit any improper direct or indirect payments or anything of value to or from any customers, agents, counterparties or other business relationships or authorities. included in the companyâs guidelines are due diligence processes designed to screen certain proposed business relationships with third parties that could have authority to make payments on garminâs behalf, including distributors, consultants, agents, and outside law firms. this due diligence process includes an analysis of the related risks and the need to implement safeguards, the results of which are reviewed and approved by our legal department prior to entering into an agreement. once garmin has retained a third party, additional due diligence is performed periodically and as needed. garmin is subject to complex and changing global laws and regulations, including those related to anticorruption, bribery, and anti-money laundering. we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable global laws and regulations, including those discussed above. please refer to our 2023 form 10-k, in particular part i, item 1a, for additional information on the risks and uncertainties facing the company. footno see garmin.com/globalpolicy 2 co2e calculated using conversion factors available from the united states environmental protection agencyâs emissions & generation resource integrated database (egrid) and other authoritative sources 3 assuming all-day wear with 3 hours per day outside in 50,000 lux conditions 4 see garmin.com/privacypolicy 5 this metric does not include garmin's seasonal, intern, or temporary employees 6 see garmin.com/codeofconduct 7 see garmin.com/sustainabilityreports 8 see garmin.com/modernslavery 9 see garmin.com/suppliercodeofconduct 10see garmin.com/conflictminerals 11based on communications equipment manufacturing (naics: 334200)","gilead statement of disclosure and compliance with section 54 of the modern slavery act (uk) and the california transparency in supply chains act introduction gilead sciences ltd, gilead sciences international ltd. and gilead sciences europe ltd. (collectively, \"gilead uk\") and gilead sciences, inc. and kite pharma, inc. (collectively, \"gilead us\"; together with gilead uk, \"gilead\"), are committed to maintaining the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct. gilead recognises the seriousness and importance of combatting modern slavery and human trafficking and is committed to fully understanding and taking all appropriate action to address any slavery and human trafficking risks in our own business and in our supply chains. our business gilead is committed to creating a healthier world for all people, and has a mission to discover, develop and deliver innovative therapeutics for people with life-threatening diseases through bold and transformative sciences. gilead's principal business activity is the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products for human healthcare. gilead operates in a highly regulated environment. it uses a combination of gilead owned facilities and strategic third-party partners to manufacture and distribute gilead products worldwide. gilead sells pharmaceutical products to hospitals, retail pharmacies and other healthcare providers in the uk, us and worldwide. gilead also provides technical and support services to group companies in connection with our pharmaceutical products. gilead's global headquarters are located in foster city, california. gilead uk is based in the uk and carries out business in the uk. gilead us is based in the us and carries out business in the us and worldwide. gilead operates and manages its subsidiaries through global policies, systems and processes that are designed to ensure consistency across the group, including third party contract governance, audit processes and oversight. in september 2022, gilead acquired mirobio ltd (a uk company, but not a reporting entity for the purposes of this statement) and has made considerable progress integrating mirobio into gileadâs operational practices. gilead continues to work to ensure that mirobio complies with the same standards as gilead uk in order to mitigate the risks of modern slavery within mirobio. gileadâs employees gilead believes that the risk of modern slavery in our directly employed workforce is relatively low. this is due in part to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical industry, and to our employees being largely educated or skilled, and/or undertaking work in controlled environments such as gilead offices and laboratories. nevertheless, we recognise that there is a risk that needs to be addressed. one way we have addressed this risk is by reorganising the way we carry out the recruitment of our directly employed workforce. we have consolidated our recruitment supply base so that we now work closely with only a few strategic partners on a global basis, rather than with a large number of third-party recruitment agencies. code of ethics gilead's core values are integrity, teamwork, accountability, inclusion and excellence, embedding respect for human rights and labour rights across the business. this includes demonstrating ethical and moral conduct, as well as adhering to laws, regulations, and company policies. the core values, in particular the values of integrity and accountability, are interwoven throughout gilead's code of ethics, which all our (newline)  (newline) personnel (our officers, directors, employees, temporary staff and contractors, hereafter collectively \"personnel\") are required to comply with. gilead also expects and requires all third parties performing services for us, or with whom we partner or collaborate, to act in a way which is consistent with the principles in our code of ethics. human rights and sustainability are part of our code of ethics. reporting, investigating concerns and internal accountability gilead personnel are required to report potential violations of laws, regulations, company policies (including the gilead code of ethics) and any other serious wrongdoing within gilead. to facilitate disclosures and help protect anonymity, personnel can report any concerns through gilead's ethics hotline. gilead investigates all allegations of misconduct and circumstances that implicate potential violations of laws, regulations or company policies. violations are not tolerated and can lead to disciplinary action, including termination of employment (where applicable). supplier code of conduct gilead recognises that exposure to the risk of modern slavery increases when we engage with third parties, particularly in such areas of our business as catering, cleaning, transportation, protective equipment and clothing, warehousing, construction, manufacturing, packaging, and promotional goods suppliers. as part of our procurement and supply chain strategy, we employ responsible sourcing, supplier inclusion, auditing procedures, green chemistry and sustainable manufacturing and distribution principles to minimize the impact from our procurement and supply chain practices. just as gilead does not condone the use of slavery or human trafficking in our own operations, we do not tolerate such practices within our supply chain, and we endeavour to select suppliers who share these standards. gilead maintains a code of conduct for suppliers (âsupplier code of conductâ), reflecting the importance to gilead of ethical business practices and principles of behaviour. the supplier code of conduct stipulates that suppliers must comply with applicable laws, regulations and gilead standards, and prohibits the use of forced labour or human trafficking within the supply chain. in 2023, gilead initiated revisions to the supplier code of conduct with a view to further strengthening the codeâs commitment to human rights. supplier certification gilead expects its suppliers to apply the principles of the supplier code of conduct during the performance of each supplierâs responsibilities. as gileadâs business expands into new markets and supply chains, gilead has translated its supplier code of conduct into ten languages. the supplier code of conduct can therefore be shared with prospective suppliers globally and used as part of the supplier selection process. refusal by a supplier to commit to the supplier code of conductâs principles is an important factor in deciding whether to do business with a supplier. all contractual arrangements between gilead and our suppliers stipulate compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and in some cases specifically reference laws concerning slavery and human trafficking. gilead is entitled to terminate supplier contracts where suppliers have not met their contractual obligations in this regard. gilead encourages suppliers to use management systems to facilitate continual (newline)  (newline) improvement and compliance with the expectations of the supplier code of conduct, and to identify, assess and manage risks in all areas, including their own operations and supply chains. supplier audits gilead monitors its suppliers as part of our supplier relationship management programme. this may involve routine in-person meetings between gilead management and our suppliers where appropriate. gilead uses its own personnel and, also in certain circumstances, independent third parties, to carry out regular and ad hoc audits and site inspections of our manufacturing and packaging suppliers to ensure compliance with quality agreements. these suppliers may also be subject to ad hoc audits and inspection by government authorities. whilst slavery and human trafficking are not specific targets of these audits, gilead personnel conducting these audits are expected to escalate any such observations or suspicions immediately. in 2023, there were no issues raised that were associated with forced or child labour in the facilities audited under this programme. gileadâs supplier assessment programme aids gilead in addressing social and ethical risks(including health and safety; human trafficking; modern slavery, including forced, bonded, involuntary prison and child labour; discrimination and unfair treatment; and business integrity), environmental, operational, and other risks within its supply chain. gilead must be satisfied that suppliers protect workers as evidenced through health and safety performance and by other means, including verification of the management framework for accident or injury, investigation and checks on incident records during onsite assessments of suppliers, and satisfying ourselves that worker protection is under the direction of clearly identified and accountable individuals possessing the appropriate technical and managerial skills, training, and knowledge. in 2023, gilead completed supplier site assessment audits that directly utilised the pharmaceutical supply chain initiative (âpsciâ) resources and approaches. these psci audits generally consider all or part of the pillars described in the psci principles (i.e. ethics, labor & human rights, health & safety, environment and management systems) and in the psci audit guidance. we continue to evaluate the most practicable and effective ways to ensure compliance and continual improvement amongst our value chain partners. training as part of responsible sourcing management programmes, gilead provides targeted on-line and in\u0002person training to key personnel involved in the management of suppliers which specifically addresses slavery and human trafficking. gilead intends to provide training on these legal risks at a broader level to other business functions within the organisation once we have completed our current enterprise-wide reassessment of third-party risk management. uk supply chain controls gilead uk requires key suppliers to comply with the modern slavery act 2015 (\"act\") and the supplier code of conduct. furthermore, gilead ukâs standard supply of services contract requires all suppliers to warrant that they are not aware of any conduct or circumstances within any part of their business or supply chain anywhere in the world that may constitute slavery and human trafficking, as defined in (newline)  (newline) section 54(12) of the act. in its higher risk contracts, gilead uk has the right to audit suppliers to ensure they comply with the act. industry collaboration gilead invests in cross-industry collaboration as part of our ongoing efforts to address a wide range of global challenges that affect communities worldwide. gilead has chosen to join other like-minded companies in support of the united nations global compact (âungcâ) - a voluntary initiative that is designed to align industries in the name of human rights, labour standards, environmental protection, and anti-corruption practices. gilead is integrating the ungc principles into our strategy, culture, and day\u0002to-day operations. additionally, gilead is committed to responsible supply chain practices. gilead joined the psci in 2018. the psci has developed a framework that can be leveraged to address common issues in pharmaceutical supply chains: (1) freely chosen employment, (2) child labor and young workers, (3) non-discrimination, (4) fair treatment, (5) wages, benefits, and working hours, and (6) freedom of association. these standards set our expectations on these issues. as a member of psci, gilead promotes responsible practices that will continuously improve social, health, safety, and environmentally sustainable outcomes. gilead actively participates in psci committees, driving positive change within gilead, and across the pharmaceutical industry through collaborative efforts with peer member companies. gileadâs involvement with psci continues to shape our implementation of best practices, as evidenced above by utilisation of psci standards and approachesin the audit activities we conduct in our key supplier facilities. california transparency in supply chains act this statement is made pursuant to the california transparency in supply chains act of 2010 (sb 657) in respect of gilead us. uk modern slavery act this statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the act in respect of gilead uk and constitutes the slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 december 2023 for gilead uk and sets out the steps taken to address modern

zweigniederlassung deutschland this statement has been issued by nike retail b.v. pursuant to section 6 of the german supply chain due diligence act (lieferkettensorgfaltpflichtengesetz â âlksgâ) with respect to its nike retail b.v. zweigniederlassung deutschland operations (together, ânikeâ). this statement discusses nikeâs global business practices to address human rights and environmental risks because nike takes a global approach to human rights and the environment. overview nike believes in and is committed to respecting human rights and the environment in its own operations and supply chain, so that every athlete* has a chance to thrive. as best practice for understanding and managing human rights risks and its impacts, nike looks to the universal declaration of human rights, the international labour organizationâs declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work, the un guiding principles on business and human rights and the oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises. nikeâs human rights expectations apply to its own business operations as well as its supply chain. through collaborative efforts, together, nike and its suppliers continue striving to create equal playing fields for all. governance nike has established a human rights committee (the âcommitteeâ) to oversee its risk management with respect to compliance with the lksg. the committee is comprised of a team of cross-functional senior leaders and subject matter experts representing nike global and europe, the middle east and africa (emea) business functions. the committee meets regularly and reports at least annually to the nike retail b.v. board of directors. priorities nikeâs priorities are based on the issues that are most salient to stakeholders (including employees, consumers, customers, suppliers, shareholders, governments, local communities and the general public) in its own operations and across its supply chain. this includes both human rights and environment-related risks. as part of nikeâs efforts to better understand the potential human rights and environmental risks its stakeholders could be exposed to in its own operations and across its supply chain â and nikeâs ability to manage these risks â nike conducted a risk assessment in early 2024 covering human rights and environmental standards under the lksg across key areas of its supply chain, including sourcing, (newline)  (newline) manufacturing, logistics and owned and operated facilities. these risks were identified in both an abstract way through a review of internal policies and disclosures and external landscaping of industry trends and performance, as well as a concrete way through interviews with key nike stakeholders. the assessment considered scope, scale, remediability and likelihood of occurrence, and identified the following most salient general risks to nike and its supply chain: 1.) occupational health and safety; 2.) forced or compulsory labor and human trafficking; and 3.) child labor. nikeâs annual impact report also includes an issues prioritization matrix identifying key issues that are salient to nike, people and the environment. nike addresses potential risks in human rights and environmental standards in its management and risk-mitigation systems across the enterprise using a risk-based approach that considers internal and external impacts. however, recognizing that risks can evolve over time, nike is evaluating risks annually with the committee and on an ad-hoc basis, as necessary, to ensure that its approach remains effective. nike is also working with key stakeholders across its business to ensure risks are appropriately identified, managed and mitigated. employees nike promotes a culture of inclusion, dignity and respect, and a work environment free from harassment and discrimination where all employees can feel empowered. nikeâs corporate code of conduct â inside the lines provides an overview of the laws, regulations and company policies that include our commitment to human rights and environmental standards. these expectations apply to the company and its own operations and reinforce how nike builds a diverse and inclusive culture. suppliers in nikeâs supply chain and their workers nike is prioritizing and fostering relationships with upstream suppliers who share nikeâs commitment to respect human rights and the environment, and who are investing in their employees. nikeâs expectations towards its suppliers are laid out in its supplier code of conduct and code leadership standards (cls). nike strives to align its supplier code of conduct with international standards, including the un guiding principles on business and human rights and oecd guidelines for multinational enterprises, by establishing foundational social and environmental requirements suppliers must meet when producing products for nikeâs business. the cls contains more detailed requirements on how the nike supplier code of conduct is implemented. they also include specifications on the development of robust management systems, which are essential to consistently maintaining compliance with local laws and nikeâs own standards on human rights and the environment. nike assesses its foundational expectations for its suppliers through industry tools, including verified social & labor convergence program (slcp) assessments, higg facility environmental module (higg fem) assessments and zero discharge of hazardous chemicals (zdhc) wastewater testing. nike also assesses environmental and social performance through regular audits, both announced and unannounced, by internal and external parties. (newline)  (newline) if nike identifies or is alerted to a non-compliance with its supplier code of conduct, nike investigates, and where improvements are required, takes a collaborative approach to working with supplier management to see that corrective actions are taken and that problems are remediated. nikeâs robust compliance program includes cross-functional governance from senior stakeholders across its business and is designed to enable both current and potential suppliers to meet nikeâs foundational expectations for conducting business with nike. beyond compliance, nike works with its suppliers to advance progress in line with nikeâs enterprise targets focused on preventing and further mitigating human rights risks in health and safety, and promoting gender equity and worker engagement. preventative measures and remedial action nike is committed to human rights and environmental standards and pursues both through preventative measures and, where needed, remedial action. such measures include proactive engagement with stakeholders, regular communication with suppliers, strong contractual obligations and safeguards that require adherence for anyone doing business with nike, verified social and environmental assessments, announced and unannounced facility audits and involvement in industry partnerships and forums focused on driving effective prevention and remediation of actual and potential human rights and environment-related violations. nike aims to use its leverage in the best possible and most efficient way to mitigate and remediate actionable identified risks or violations. this response includes, where necessary, considering options for responsible exit. access to nikeâs grievance mechanisms nike works to provide safe, confidential and easily accessible channels to enable anyone to report on potential adverse impacts and grievances. the speak up portal is available to nike employees and individuals in and outside its supply chain and can be accessed anytime online or by phone, enabling further direct communication about any concerns. available in 39 languages and accessible locally in 98 countries, anyone who experiences or observes conduct they suspect to be inconsistent with nikeâs human rights and environmental expectations or obligations under the lksg may use the speak up portal. nike treats all reports seriously, respects confidentiality throughout the grievance process, and does not tolerate retaliation in any form in response to submissions to the speak up portal. grievance themes and trends are reviewed regularly and on a holistic basis by the committee to identify any systemic risks or gaps in nikeâs systems and processes. nike also conducts regular trainings with key internal stakeholders to ensure grievances are managed consistently across nikeâs supply chain. documentation and reporting nike takes appropriate steps to document its approach to, and management of, human rights and environmental risks. this process includes statutory requirements for documentation and record (newline)  (newline) retention under the lksg, as well as mandatory reporting on forced labor pursuant to the uk modern slavery act, the australian modern slavery act, the canadian forced and child labour in supply chain act and the california transparency in supply chains act. in addition, nike has a long history of voluntary reporting and disclosure on human rights â including risk management â through its annual impact report. for more information on nikeâs human rights approach, please visit https://about.nike.com/en/impact-resources/human-rights-and-labor-compliance-standards. there is no finish line nike recognizes that strong and effective human rights and

changeâ approach to agricultural labor practices continues to deliver in mexico share facebook twitter linkedin copy copy copy mail respect for human rights is embedded in pmi â s culture, governing our working practices in the communities where we operate. our code of conduct and responsible sourcing principles sets the global standard for the way we work with employees, farmers, and suppliers. the impact of this can be felt throughout the world, including nayarit in the west of mexico â a region known for its complex tobacco chain. â  farmworkers migrate with their families from mexico â s highlands to settle in tobacco-growing areas for several months, leaving them vulnerable to issues around human and labor rights. pmi is proactive in combatting these issues to ensure all workers are treated fairly. we do this by monitoring practices and identifying improvement opportunities to act upon. â  a good example of our commitment to respect the universal declaration of human rights, is the work we are doing with our agricultural labor practices (alp) program. the alp program, introduced in 2011, is focused on eliminating child labor and other labor abuses and providing a decent livelihood for all contracted farmers supplying tobacco to pmi. the program is currently being implemented in 24 countries, including mexico, in the region of nayarit. in 2018, pmi introduced the â s tep change â approach, and mexico was identified as the appropriate learning ground for the particular complexity of its tobacco supply chain. â  by the time that the step change approach had been introduced, the global alp program had reached an important level of maturity, providing a more accurate assessment of the program â s overall performance, and the improvement opportunities pmi could act upon. the step change approach was deployed to achieve significant, long-term change for the most recurring issues in the most impacted locations, such as nayarit. with the step change approach, pmi committed to ambitious targets, including: zero child labor in pmi â s tobacco supply chain by 2025. 100 percent of tobacco farmworkers paid at least the minimum legal wage by 2022. 100 percent of tobacco farmworkers provided with safe and adequate accommodation by the end of 2020. 100 percent of farmers and workers having access to personal protective equipment (ppe) for the application of crop protection agents (cpa) and prevention of green tobacco sickness (gts) by the end of 2020. eliminating child labor: a step change in mexico pmiâs commitment to address the challenge of child labor and other labor rights issues in its tobacco growing supply chain is yielding results read more in mexico, pmi sources tobacco from a third-party supplier, tpn (tabacos del pac ã­ f ico norte â a subsidiary of universal corporation). tpn implements the step change approach through the sustenta program, which introduced a comprehensive action plan with targeted initiatives on the ground to address the identified risks. the peculiarity of the supply chain in nayarit is that farmers rely heavily on migrant workers from the cora and wix ã¡ r itari (or huichol) indigenous groups. these workers migrate with their families from mexico â s highlands and settle in tobacco-growing areas for several months each year. they are vulnerable due to their migrant status and indigenous cultures, and this exposes them to potential human rights and labor rights risks, such as poor living and working conditions, limited access to the appropriate personal protective equipment (ppe), a nd working at night. the earnings during the tobacco season are typically the main source of annual income for these indigenous families. maximizing the number of working hours â a nd consequently their income â i s the main reason they often prefer living and sleeping on the field, so they don â t lose time and money commuting. the potential human rights and labor rights risks identified in this analysis resulted in a holistic set of initiatives to be implemented through sustenta. these include increasing the piece-rate wage paid to workers by 25 percent (ensuring the same income while respecting the legal working time), â  improving workers â accommodation, providing the necessary ppe, constructing resting areas on the fields, and funding childcare centers. extensive communication efforts were also undertaken with the objective of informing farmers and both local and migrant workers of the program and its benefits. 10/12/2020

Logistic Regression Model\n- The logistic regression takes these vectors as input and learns to classify them as ‘relevant’ (i.e., referring to a high-risk good) or ‘irrelevant’ (e.g. “gold medal”).\n- During training, it learns which words or combinations are strong predictors of contextual relevance.\n- Once trained, it can filter new mentions of goods and retain only those in meaningful, risk-related contexts.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3a10e2e4-30ae-477f-9b4d-089614ee9994"},{"source":"# Separate features and labels\nX = labelled_snippets[\"Text_Snippet\"]\ny = labelled_snippets[\"Label\"]\n\n# Convert text to numeric vectors\nvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2), max_features=5000)\nX_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X)\n\n# Train/test split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_vec, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Train logistic regression model\nclf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predict\ny_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate\nprint(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":68,"lastExecutedAt":1746880263437,"lastExecutedByKernel":"823a9b96-91fb-4cee-97d6-f6c74137b7a1","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Separate features and labels\nX = labelled_snippets[\"Text_Snippet\"]\ny = labelled_snippets[\"Label\"]\n\n# Convert text to numeric vectors\nvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2), max_features=5000)\nX_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X)\n\n# Train/test split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_vec, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Train logistic regression model\nclf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predict\ny_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate\nprint(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":248,"type":"stream"}}},"id":"1a31406a-d7d7-4445-8b8c-99296c42717f","cell_type":"code","execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"[[164   0]\n [ 43   8]]\n              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           0       0.79      1.00      0.88       164\n           1       1.00      0.16      0.27        51\n\n    accuracy                           0.80       215\n   macro avg       0.90      0.58      0.58       215\nweighted avg       0.84      0.80      0.74       215\n\n"}]},{"source":"The model pefroms very badly.
